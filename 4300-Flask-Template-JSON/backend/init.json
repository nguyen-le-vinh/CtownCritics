            "Im only leaving this review so some one at this place might see it. What happened the broth with the tan tan men? It used to be great but last 2 times I order it tasted of nothing. 2022 tan tan men was 5 star. 2023 tan tan men 1 star",
            "A small menu with self service kiosk style counter to order from. They are happy to customize your order but you'll have to call someone out from the kitchen.",
            "Staff was great, ordering efficient the food was vile and left me feeling like I needed a shower.",
            "Great food and terrific service. The person at the counter was super nice. I recommend this place!",
            "I would say it's the worst Japanese restaurant i've ever been to. First, ramen here was nasty, even raw and sticky together, and the fish cakes were pretty expensive and not worth it. Also, the price was quite high compared to other Japanese restaurants, and they forced you to give at least 15% tips. However, they didn't provide worthy service. We had to serve ourselves and they were very rude to us when we asked about the dishes.",
            "Went here for the first time ever this weekend and it was really good. I got the tan tan men and it was spicy and flavorful. I would like to come again. There are a lot of menu options I am interested in",
            "They have delicious food at an affordable price. Numbers 19 and 20 are my go-to orders and they don't fail to impress me every time even after COVID.",
            "Perfect for college students, not so much for their parents (like me)",
            "pretty good w reasonable prices. recommend the katsu curry",
            "good food, fast and good service, okay price. overall like it\ud83d\ude0d \u2026",
            "got me through four years of college. love the katsudon and katsu curry!",
            "One of the best places to eat in collegetown. Very reasonable portions.",
            "Foods are very tasteful and  customer service is superb! Highly recommended!!",
            "One of the most delicious noodle bowl ever! So good!",
            "The katsudon was very salty (felt it like it was drenched in soy sauce) that I couldn't even finish half of it. They also added a small (strawberry?) pink drink with jelly in a container to my surprise, but it was beyond sweet that it reminded me of cough medicine. This lunch pairing was super odd, perhaps they could just add miso soup on the side instead of this. Overall, seasoning was just off and the pork cutlets were soggy already despite getting there 15 min for pick up. I guess I had expected too much from restaurants in Ithaca.",
            "I came here for lunch and it immediately became my favorite place to eat. The prices are great, the portion sizes are perfect, and the lo-fi chill hop music makes the area. Definitely the new date spot to relax and eat.",
            "Had a great first experience here. Given that it's a Collegetown restaurant with a quick-service/takeout mindset, I'd say I had a fairly reasonable expectation. More or less than authenticity and service, I simply want food that's well seasoned, hot food that's hot, and cold food that's cold. Simple, right?\n\nI had a Katsu-Don and Ramen the first time around, and it was above my expectations. Food came out piping hot, and because we ate there, it was at the optimal quality. No additional service was needed. I received what I came for.\n\nBecause of this, we decided to order again today. I wanted to try something different from last time and decided to order Kuay Toew Gai Toon (#14). This time I took it home only to realize how salty the soup was. The salinity level was that of ocean water, or as chefs would say season your water before you put your pasta in. You can imagine just how salty this soup was.\n\nI called the restaurant to explain the situation. Because of the disappointing experience, I wanted to see if they would right the wrong by letting me order something different from the menu, perhaps something that I've tried before - to which they replied, \"Our store policy is NO refund, No Exchange. It is one of our most popular dishes, and no other customers have complained about it today.\" Their attitude was \"I'm right, you're wrong, what do you want me to do about it?\" I tried to explain once again just how salty the food was and that I would really appreciate it if I could just order something else instead. They were willing the make the same thing again, but at this point, It's a lost cause. It could have been a 5 star experience through and through, but if they're willing to go as far as diminishing a guest feedback to serve their own interests, it's just not worth it.\n\nBest of luck to you.",
            "everything is SO good, truly one of my favorite places to eat in town. however, their hours are a bit wonky and i feel like every time i\u2019m craving it they\u2019re closed :(",
            "Great place to grab an Asian rice or noodle bowl. Getting an order to stay or to go takes about 10-15 minutes and the prices are all <$10. Interesting appetizer items like takoyaki will show up over time, so its worth going back.\n\nA word of caution, if you go during lunch time (12:15pm-1:15pm) during the work week, the place will be packed with Cornell students. Call ahead and skip the line!",
            "Good rice bowls, but the ramen is bland and leaves something to be desired. Takeout service is a good way to go, and wait times aren't generally very long. Overall, a good place for a quick meal to grab.",
            "great place for cheap fast Asian food fix, always a winner. I only wish it was open late! the cravings for oishii bowl when you're late night studying are no joke!",
            "Great price for the food and very quick service. Always consistently well made and the large portions are a plus. Helps satisfy the craving for Japanese Raman and rice bowls.",
            "This  is a simple no frills eatery and take out place.  I tried the katsu curry.  Very yummy and just the right amount for a meal.  This place doesn't have much seating so be ready to share table with others or just get it to go.",
            "The food here I ordered were so disgusting. Tried twice and never want to try again. The pork over rice is so smelly and gross. Just wanted to vomit at the first glance I saw it. Don\u2019t know why such store could be valid and survive here!",
            "Very good food. I ordered katsudon curry and kaarage. My partner ordered Miso Ramen and thai tea. The service was fast and good. The prices are not too expensive, just right.",
            "Tonkatsu ramen was tasty.  I will be eating the oyakodon later.",
            "The katsudon here is the best katsudon I have ever had in my entire life. If you come here and don't get the katsudon, you're missing out. Everything is very reasonably priced and although it can get very busy somehow I am always able to find a table, sit down, and eat the best comfort food around. Oishii Bowl is a must when you're in Ithaca.",
            "Best food in collegetown if you\u2019re looking to spend <$15, everything on the menu is about $11 and a good portion of food. For rice bowls and ramen Oishii is a staple at Cornell",
            "definitely not 4+ star. Not to Cali standards anyway.\nBut despite the flies practicing their freedom of speech, over-boiled brown used to be green tea, and not so fresh ingredients, I can see myself walk in here on a cold winter night for a hot noodle soup for only $8! #Collegebudget",
            "Fast, inexpensive, good portions. It's super convenient and very filling. Sometime they run out of certain items but there's a large variety so it isn't a problem.",
            "My favorite place for a quick meal and a study break.  The tonkatsu ramen is fantastic, and great comfort food. Oishii's become very popular in the past two years, so try to come during off hours to get a table.",
            "The classiest culinary establishment in town. If you never had Oishii Bowl, did you ever go/visit Cornell? It is the beating heart of collegetown, a must eat!",
            "Yum Gai Sab is off the hook. Best bowl on their menu. I\u2019d go to lunch everyday here if I could.",
            "Surprisingly good for a tiny strip-mall style place. We tried the katsu and a chicken dish and they were fresh, tasty, with really good rice. Looking forward to going back and trying the Ramen",
            "Pretty good for Japanese food! The price is reasonable. But the menu option is quite limited. Basically, a good restaurant to eat once in a while.",
            "I am very SAD, going to this place from around 6 years now, always ordered same thing, today went to the restaurant it was a new girl at the counter, ordered 2 sakana don and fishcakes, but got something else other than sakana don. 'she might heard wrong' my girlfriend called them that we can only eat fish and no other meat and don't know what to do with the dishes, she said 'I don't know'. We have decided to never go back again to this place. Really breaks my heart.",
            "It is just okay. The food is pretty good at first, but it doesn't digest well. Also, I'm pretty sure they don't actually cook the food and just heat it up in the back....",
            "One of my favorite places in Collegetown! Great food at a good price, relaxing atmosphere, and warm tea always ready to be enjoyed.",
            "We were delighted to find two veggie options . Hot rice bowl with tasty condiments is a blessing when Ithaca is cold . Pocket friendly.",
            "Most dishes contains pork, but are very delicious. The restaurant owner is very passionate and thoughtful in running the business and the restaurant was very cat fondly.",
            "Good quality and relatively inexpensive for Collegetown. Don't recommend dining in during the winter, because the inside is a bit drafty but great for take out",
            "I went here almost every other day for a year. Food is so good and it's a nice place to chill. Only request would be free wifi.",
            "Great place for ramen! I always visit this place when I am in the town. They have a variety of ramen noodles which are delicious. They have prompt service and the portion is also great! I would definitely recommend to ramen buffs.",
            "Love stopping here. Even when it\u2019s busy the wait times aren\u2019t bad and everything\u2019s always fresh. Get the udon u won\u2019t regret it",
            "The Burmese food is amazing and only available Friday through Sunday. The southeast asian selection rotate weekly. It tends to be spicy.",
            "Best place to get cheap quick ramen and your other Japanese food needs as a college student. Katsudon is wonderful!",
            "Food here is excellent, quick and cheap compared to eating on campus. You should get the fried fish bowl with cucumber.",
            "In general good for tasting some Japanese  Raman bowl or rice bowl. The flavor is good and not spicy.",
            "Food was exceptional. Pricing good.  Our first time eating there.",
            "Dont waste the drive. They are shut down. Very disappointed, tried to call and it just kept ringing. Should probably update their website with this kind of information instead of people coming to find out themselves.",
            "No frills, hot tasty food. Nice place when it's cold out. Free tea with every meal.",
            "The food is good, but it is a little pricey. Its a bit expensive for college town but its worth it on occasion",
            "Decent katsu don at a nice price. I eat here regularly and always leave satisfied.",
            "The food is ok and inexpensive here.  Not really Japanese. Don't expect foods like in Tokyo.",
            "Quite authentic taste of food.",
            "The food here is quick and cheap.  Great value for lunch between classes.",
            "Great food and great portions for the price. Fast and cordial service",
            "Their Fried Tofu is one of my favorites, but they have only two vegetarian options, Dried and Fried Tofu.",
            "Worst pseudo-Japanese food I had. Flies droning around the restaurant, the Raman is of instant-noodle quality.",
            "The food is amazing and comes out quickly, plus the music is great.",
            "Love their rice bowls. Recommend the Oyako, Unagi and Katsu don.",
            "Good food cheap. Especially good on cold Ithaca winter days.",
            "Great steamed buns and ramen for super reasonable prices.",
            "One of the most popular spots in C-Town due to its authentic fare",
            "Food was fine for the price. Clean and fast",
            "Recommend the bun",
            "They cancelled my delivery order over an hour after I had placed it.",
            "We did not cancel any of the order, when the delivery service doesn\u2019t have a driver to pick up the order they usually cancel the order automatically, we finished your order within 10 - 20 minutes of ordering and when they cancel it due to them not having a driver within 2 hrs, we also have to throw away the meal please try to understand thank you",
            "everything is sooooooo salty. the cook obviously didn\u2019t taste his own dishes",
            "Many great options, not too expensive",
            "Definitely my favorite place to go in Ithaca!!",
            "Store needs remodeling and clean up! Food is ok.",
            "Shrimp Tempura!!!!!!\nGood faded lo fi Tokyo sound, perfect.",
            "Very nice staff and delicious food",

It\u2019s a good spot but i dont think ill order the same thing again. I would come back to order something else though!",
            "Appreciate it and thank you for letting us know wish you told us so we can make something different for you unfortunately some times the lamb is a little \u201cchewy\u201d Thank you again ",
            "Everything was delicious\u2026 eggplant parm, gyro, Greek salad, penne a la vodka.  Service was excellent. Looking forward to going back to try other dishes.",
            "Thank you very much ",
            "A good greek place to visit. Carried out a Falafel Pita sandwich. It was huge and enough for a person's lunch. Quite tasty, I must say!\nCost around $12 (11+tip) with credit card (cards add 3%). Carry cash if possible.",
            "We try to keep our prices down as much as we can for fresh made food and not frozen stuff. Unfortunately the credit card fee more and more restaurants and food establishments add to cover the use of credit card fee\u2019s none of that amount goes to the restaurant or it\u2019s workers in any shape or form. Thanks so much for your review appreciate it ",
            "Idk why people have not posted menus for this place so I will do it. Will delete if it\u2019s not allowed tho :))) Like you can\u2019t just not check it out seeing so many options and feeling it would be a nice and authentic restaurant. Food here comes in bigger portions and is cooked perfectly. I def recommend the lamb souvlaki. I will come to try the pizza and desserts next time!",
            "Thank you so much so much appreciate it!",
            "Absolutely amazing and authentic gyro. Everything was put together with great care and packs enormous, rich flavor. Love this restaurant!!",
            "Thank you so much",
            "Love this place.  Friendly staff.   Good portions. Excellent pricing.   Poured me a beautiful glass of wine twice the amount I'd get at other restaurants.  Really liked this place and the staff.  Everyone seemed happy and joking in the backroom.  Very family oriented place.   I really liked it.",
            "Delicious food in a nice casual atmosphere with exceptionally friendly service. They have both Greek and Italian favorites, like souvlaki and pasta. Definitely worth checking out!",
            "Visiting my girlfriends brother at Cornell and happy to say we chose the right dinner spot. Delicious food and I can say with absolute certainty it is the best Greek/Italian fusion in Ithaca. \ud83e\udd0c\ud83e\udd0c\ud83e\udd0c",
            "Appreciate it thank you!",
            "Moussaka was really good. However, I ordered the lamb souvlaki and it was overflowing with lettuce. There were 4 pieces of meat which were so tough that they were inedible. A knife would not cut through them.\nWe kinda expected more from a namesake dish.\nThey do not split bills either.",
            "Excellent Greek salad and pizza. Also a filling and large calzone. Very tasty and fast friendly service.",
            "Thank you so much appreciate it",
            "Considering the price and quality of this restaurant, I think it is underrated in the area. Prices compared to the rest of collegetown are very reasonable for the level of service and quality of food. I have yet to have a bad service experience, one time even when I was in a large group staying up to closing...",
            "Thank you so much ",
            "Strange place. A bit dirty but not too bad. Worst gyros I\u2019ve ever seen (photo attached, partially eaten), like mystery meat. However, the lamb souvlaki was actually delicious, I recommend it. Nice service and friendly people. Again, gyros were terrible, don\u2019t do those but the souvlaki was very very good.",
            "We have the same recipe for our gyro for almost 50 years and people love it if it wasn\u2019t to your taste we understand also we clean our restaurant all the time and our kitchen is open for everyone to see you will be surprised what the closed kitchen look like! Thanks for your review",
            "Traditional family restaurant.  It's not fancy, but it has good, traditional Greek favorites, as well as a few Italian dishes like meatballs and ravioli.  Good for dining in, or carryout.",
            "Thanks so much ",
            "I\u2019ve gone to souvlaki house for 30 years and have never once had a bad meal. Their greek salad is so delicious and included with most entrees. 1000% try when you\u2019re looking for large portions of inexpensive delicious food served with a smile!",
            "We thank you so much ",

            "Thank you",

            "We are very happy you enjoyed everything thank you so much",
            "Don\u2019t be afraid to try out the Italian menu, just because of the restaurants name! I have NEVER had such a good pesto pasta in my entire life! A friend who went to Cornell just shy of a DECADE ago still remembers this restaurant and actually recommended it.\n\nGo for the angel hair pasta or a long pasta in general, it complements the pesto sauce.\n\nAlso amazing options included the chicken souvlaki platter, it was flavorful but not over salted like many other restaurants.",
            "We are happy you enjoyed everything thanks so much",
            "Was a decent meal a little boring and chicken was very dry. The menu is too large. I think it would benefit them to have a smaller selection and focus more on the dishes. Felt very filthy inside. The place definitely needs some love and the carpet ripped out. Didn't have the pizza so can't speak on that.",
            "Will try harder next time \ud83d\udc4d \u2026",
            "Had been there before and loved it . However, they are no longer great. Probably won't go back . The lamb in the gyro was tuff and so large it wasn't sandwich material . The same with the chicken gyro . 7",
            "The only good thing about this restaurant is the large portion sizes but you do pay a hefty price for the hefty meal.\n\nI went on a Friday afternoon at around 3:00 pm. Experienced long wait times for drinks and the appetizers I ordered. I got my large order of a bland Seafood Alfredo pasta (if you even want to call it seafood when there were like 2 shrimps and imitation crab) after finishing a poorly made salad.\n\nNot only am I a college student who is struggling financially, I didn't appreciate the service nor the food. I paid for my meal and gave a poor tip. Moments later, as I was leaving the restaurant, a worker called me out complaining about my poor tip. Before allowing me to explain myself (which I definitely don't need to do), the worker goes on explaining to me that they \"kill themselves working so hard\". The worker calls me out in front of the restaurant, speaking loudly, instead of acting professionally and bringing her complaint to me (a customer) in private.\n\nHorrible experience, never returning there again.",
            "I usually respond to all our customers this message going to all three of you I was here don\u2019t need to tell me what happened it\u2019s one thing if you didn\u2019t like the food that\u2019s matter of taste but putting my co workers down isn\u2019t cool after 51 years in business people know who we are and what we do. All of us work really hard and always do the best for everyone including all 3 of you!! If you don\u2019t want to put a tip don\u2019t it\u2019s ok but can\u2019t stand you coming up with excuses. People work very hard so please don\u2019t insult my co workers friends and family!",
            "Every time I went with my buddies in a small group, I've consistently had a B+ experience with solid/good food and usually solid service (although wait times can be long). However, the times I've come with a big party, the food that we've been served was not even mediocre in quality - the meatballs tasted unfresh, the chicken parm was average, and the pasta + marinara sauce felt microwaved. I'll give Souvlaki credit with their breadsticks, however;  they're great.\n\nIn addition, I feel like their menu is too expansive. It's overwhelming for customers and probably the chefs too and I feel like everyone would benefit from a smaller menu.",
            "We try hard to please everyone but unfortunately we can\u2019t",
            "This place is really good. Great for large groups and fast good service. Would recommend especially if you live in college town. The bread is amazing. Also try the pasta!",
            "Good service, clean tables, and delicious food. Got the seafood Alfredo, and it was well worth the $20 - I'll be eating this meal for four days! Can't wait to come back again and try the rest of their fantastic food. Please tip generously, they deserve it!",
            "Thanks so much we all appreciate you",
            "Ok so I read the reviews before going and almost didn't go. We ordered the Hummos, Souvlaki platter and Gyro platter. Portion were very generous.\nAs others have said the gyro was a little unsalted but I liked it. Some places make it very salty. I just added a little more salt and pepper with the Tatziki sauce it was yummy.\nThe staff are very friendly and served us on time. It was a clean atmosphere. I will definitely return.",
            "Thanks so much",
            "Fantastic Greek food. I have now came to Cornell for business trips a total of 4 times. Every time I have gotten food from Souvlaki House, and every time it has been absolutely fantastic. I lived right outside \"Greek Town\" in Baltimore for 5+ years, and adore Greek food. They do it right here. The dolmades, the souvlaki, the gyro, the salad, the bread, everything is fantastic. Highly recommend.",
            "So much appreciate it",
            "The food is amazing and the owners are just wonderful.  I highly recommend this restraunt for anyone that likes Greek.",
            "We thank you so much ",
            "We did not get what we ordered, and they are not answering the phone. We are staying at a remote hotel w/o dinner options, and so we ordered enough food for two hungry people. They delivered, to the front desk, something completely different from our order - and only enough food for one person. Never mind that we *way overpaid* for what was delivered, it was only enough for one, and we are two. Two hungry people. And they are not answering the phone.\n\nDo not order food from these clowns.",
            "Sorry for any mix up happened from the delivery company and you got this wrong bag with food to you no one is at the restaurant after business hours to answer the phone",
            "Fantastic Greek salad and the moussaka is amazing!  Love the lamb and chicken Souvlaki, and can't forget the fresh made tzatziki that goes perfectly on everything!",
            "Thank you so much ",
            "One of my favorite places to eat whenever I'm in Ithaca! Been here three times.  Food is always great, service is great, and I have never gone wrong with anything I've ordered.  Love this place!  If you like Greek food, Souvlaki House is a must when in the Ithaca area.",
            "We all souvlaki house family thank you so much",
            "If I could give no stars I would. Poor service and very slow. Not only that but one of the waiters yelled at a student who gave a poor tip. VERY CHILDISH. Poor guy I felt horrible for him. She should have handled that situation better and not let the whole restaurant know he should have tipped more. Tipping shouldn't be the responsibility of the customers, maybe she should ask her boss for a raise instead of yelling at a poor kid. Also the Alfredo is flavorless and the crab is imitation. Don't recommend",
            "The service was fast and polite however the gyro platter I ordered was udderly disappointing, the pita was so hard I could not cut through it with the steak knife they gave me, and the meat looked and tasted and had the texture of steamed cardboard. Tziki sauce was ok, the seafood alfredo was pretty good and the baklava was delicious.  Appetizers were good and quick.",
            "Thanks for letting us know we will work harder and make it better next time",
            "Food was good. Not great. Salad and bread sticks are a highlight. But the service stole the show. Friendly, attentive waitress made eating out with three kids a joy, and we will definitely be back!",
            "Thank you very much appreciate it",
            "This was the first place I ate at when I first moved to Ithaca 3 years ago. Been going for the excellent Italian food and awesome Greek salad ever since. The owner is super sweet and the staff is always friendly. The food is always good. Had their pizza for the first time today and it was perfect.",
            "Thanks so much we need all the encouragement and support in these strange times! Appreciate it stay healthy",
            "No frills atmosphere but food and service were grand.  Affordable pricing on Italian and Greek fare.",
            "Thank you !",
            "We ordered Moussaka and the Souvlaki plates. Both were seasoned beautifully! The server and owners made us feel like family, sharing the birthday cake made especially for their family celebration. Delicious",
            "You are very kind thanks for everything we want people to feel like family when they are here! Thanks again",
            "Excellent food, friendly people, great for family, and marinara to die for ... this was the place my kids craved most during quarantine, in all of Ithaca.\n\nI highly recommend the Chicken or Meatball Parmigiana. The meatballs are just incredible, uniquely Mediterranean. These are also featured in their delicious Souvlaki House Special, including eggplant. Excuse me, my mouth is watering...\n\nLess well-known, perhaps, to the college crowd, who clearly love their Gyros, is the excellent pizza, really some of the best in Ithaca. Now that the Nines is gone, it maybe the most unique.\n\nWhen restaurants reopen for service, this will be one of the first places we visit. It's a simple space but welcoming, always popular, enough to be a beloved place for small family events ... last time we were there someone was celebrating a 94th birthday.\n\nAn Ithaca icon.",
            "Some of the worst Greek food in yeArs. Moussaka was dried out solidified cream sauce,hardly any eggplant and a bunch of ground beef / looked like it had been sitting around for hours. Gyro platter was a lot of meat just thrown on a plate. No tomato or onion, just a soggy pita underneath and some decent tzitziti sauce. Greek salad a bunch of iceberg and pale tomatoes, some barely discernible feta, no anchovies and middling dressing.\nThe service was fine - that\u2019s why two stars. If I could just rate the server she would get 5 stars.",
            "The Italian food is great. The Greek food is awful.",
            "Thank you",
            "Great Greek / Italian menu.  Enjoyed the falafel and Souvlaki.  Pleasant prompt service.  My only problem: too much food! (A good problem :)\nUpdate: I'm always on the lookout to re-experience Mykonos 1970 - a few drachma for Souvlaki (served out of a hole in the wall) - about a quarter size of the one experienced here!  And easier to handle :-)",
            "Thank you so much",
            "This place is a great place to go for comforting food. Their moussaka is great and their salad and breadsticks are super reminiscent of Olive Garden's. They are BYOB which is lovely. I happened to be here when there was a lightning storm and the power went out. They brought around pieces of apple with candles in them - an unexpected romantic setting! We still got our food though so it works out! Not the best food but a decent place for a cheap meal.",
            "We\u2019re visiting Ithaca and had a craving for Greek food, so we stopped into Souvlaki House around 4:40 PM to order some dinner for take-out.\n\nWe walked into an empty restaurant (no surprise given the COVID-19 pandemic) and were promptly greeted. We asked to place a to-go order and were immediately offered a menu to browse.\n\nThe menu is extensive and features Greek and Italian food.\n\nWe ordered two gyros, a toasted ravioli appetizer, and two orders of baklava. We then explored Collegetown on foot. 15 minutes later we returned, and our food was ready!\n\nWe brought it back to our hotel and dug right in. The gyros? Fantastic! They featured a VERY generous amount of lettuce, tomatoes, taziki sauce, and gyro meat. We both opted to order them sans onions. I added feta for $1 additional.\n\nLet me start by saying they gave me a WONDERFUL amount of feta for my $1! I\u2019m used to restaurants being very skimpy with the feta. This place was not! The pita was tasty, and we also like the gyro meat. All ingredients tasted fresh!\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 said the toasted ravioli was average. We weren\u2019t expecting that to be a show-stopper anyways. The baklava?! Oh my! Amazing! They are HUGE! They tasted homemade whereas most places we order from back in PA they taste frozen and mass-produced.\n\nWe will definitely return when we visit Ithaca again! Thanks for a DELICIOUS dinner!",
            "Thank you so much means the world to us! Appreciate it",
            "Generous portions of delicious food! Eggplant, veal, ravioli and spanakopita were beautifully prepared and piping hot. Staff and owner-amazing hospitality-filotimo.",
            "You are very kind thanks so much",
            "Best Greek experience so far! Got the Greek fries for starters (a must) then we got a Greek(lamb) souvlaki and a chicken both were out of this world.  The waitress was awesome as well! 2 thumbs up and a definite return!!!",
            "Thanks so much appreciate it",
            "I got the lamb souvlaki with tsatsiki. It tasted good but was mostly lettuce. It was during lunch time but didn't seem that busy. Still took a long time to get our check and nobody mentioned that we had to take it up to the register, so we waited at the table for a while. Eventually we brought the check to the register and they wouldn't split it.\n\nThey have a good variety of cold beer, which is nice.",
            "Will try better next time to please you thanks",
            "Odd assortment of menu items ranging from traditional Italian and Mediterranean to fried American bar foods. I'm a big fan nonetheless - the food was great and the service was A+.\n\nBeware of the Baklava Cheesecake - it's dangerously good.",
            "Thanks so much we love what we do and I am  happy people like it! Appreciate it",
            "I am pretty sure that they have no salt in their kitchen. It seems that they did not season their pasta water with salt, and the meatball tastes blend. I mean, plz just season the meat with some salt and pepper, simple things to do\u2026 btw, there is not enough sauce on that pasta. the French fries are also not salted. The salad was ok. And they do make a huge portion for ppl. In general, food taste ok and comes in large portion, but please, use some salt",
            "Thanks so much lots of our customers don\u2019t like lots of salt so we are a little careful but we scan add a little more you could have asked for more sauce when you were here eating with us and we could have take care of that part",
            "Welcoming atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food. Service was a bit slow due to the dinner rush. Portion sizes were adequate and they didn't skimp on the cheese with the salad. Warm family restaurant vibes.",
            "We appreciate it thanks for everything",
            "My husband and I lived in Ithaca a couple years back and Souvlaki House was one of our go-tos. After making a day trip to Ithaca today, we decided to stop by to grab something to eat. We walked in and wasn't even greeted, but told to sit wherever we wanted. We sat and the same miserable waitress came over and threw our menus on the table (again with no greeting or anything). It took me one second to make the decision to not eat there. I don't care how good your food is, if your customer service sucks, I will not give my hard earned money to you. If you hate your job get a new one!",
            "First off my apologies for the behavior of any of my employees really sorry that you felt that way and I will look into this and a meeting will be done ASAP. Our goal here is for us to make sure our customers are taking care the best and like our families. I again apologize and I want you to know I will try to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again to you or anyone else.",
            "I'm not sure if it is the restaurant itself, or the fact that it was takeout, but the food we received today was almost inedible. I understand charred chicken, but the entire outside of all of the chicken we received was black and burnt. The chicken itself was incredibly dry. Also, the \"breadsticks\" were hotdog buns with some garlic salt thrown on top. As I said, maybe it was because it was takeout, but it definitely deterred me from wanting to ever go in to try it. A sad experience considering the online reviews were generally good.",
            "I think you should have let us know so we can maybe cook it more to your liking. We are really sorry but as you can see from all of our reviews we aren\u2019t an 1 star review restaurant and maybe it was something you didn\u2019t personally liked for whatever reason. Either way we will try to be better. Thanks",
            "Fresh, traditional Greek dishes prepared authentically. Also a wide selection of pasta and pizza. Prices are very reasonable and portions are generous.",
            "Thanks so much",
            "New owner is fabulous! He walks around to greet you at your table and really tries to engage with his customers. Big menu, so many options. Great food at very fair prices. He's going to do well!",
            "Thank you so much!!",
            "We were looking for a mid day meal and got lucky here. Portions were large and we had a nice salad to share between the two of us. It's Italian and Greek menu. Looks like the locals come often for eat in or take out .",
            "Thanks so much for stopping and having lunch with us very much appreciate it",

            "Thanks so much really appreciate it",
            "An old favorite, with great \"Greek\" pizza, plus pasta.  I've been coming here since my collegiate days far above Cayuga's waters, and that was back when REM was a hot new band from Georgia.  So, for me, memories as well as mealtime...",
            "Fantastic food!  I had the lamb souvlaki, my wife had the salmon.  Both excellent!!!\nBaklava was just right!  Go support them.  They are great people!",
            "Their tomato sauce is a can of crushed tomatoes heated up. No real tomato sauce just crushed tomatoes. The meatballs were grey and tasteless,  but what do expect since they don't simmer in sauce cause there isn't any.  The wooden table edges are sticky gross. These need to be cleaned and sealed.  Nothing here to make you want to return to this place. Keep looking, so many nice clean places in Ithaca.",
            "Thanks",
            "Excellent! The chicken souvlaki is one of the best meals I've ever had",
            "Thank you so much ",
            "Just ordered take out from here and it was just as good as eating in the restaurant! Food was hot and tasty like always! Highly recommend eating here and will definitely be back! Great service and food.",
            "Thank you so much from all is us souvlaki house family",
            "Great local hangout. Not fancy. Friendly atmosphere. Good service. The food is simple Greek and Italian food, but of higher quality that its equivalents in Ithaca. Great Souvlaki and Spanakopita.",
            "Thanks so much means everything to us for our guests to leave here happy and full! Really appreciate it",
            "Love this place . Everything is always FANTASTIC!!!",

            "Pretty good food with decent portion sizes! Servers are extremely friendly. Only slight downside is that oftentimes they don't split the check",
            "Thanks so much appreciate it",
            "If you want a taste of Real Local Ithaca - Souvlaki House. Been going here since before these Collegetown kids were born, and will continue to go well after they've gone. The 'regular': Large Greek Salad, Large Eggplant Sub (on a toasted sub loaf, layers of thinly sliced and breaded eggplant and great marinara), which we split.  A couple of beers.  The pizza is great, and Mr. P is Greek, so Greek you get.",
            "We hadn't been in several years and had a craving when we were back in town. It just wasn't as good as we remembered from years past. The baked pasta was mostly pasta with only a small amount of sauce and cheese. It was baked, but not for very long and not as magical as it was in years past.",
            "Thanks for the review",
            "Greek food, prepared fresh-done right!  This place is one of the stations we stop at whenever we find ourselves in college town.  Worth a visit for authentic Greek food -from Souvlaki to spanakopita.  You must start with the Greek Garlic Bread (as it comes with Tomatoes and Feta Cheese).  The Greek Garlic bread with feta is almost a meal on its own! Vegetarians have options including pasta with marinara, fried eggplant, Greek Salads, Primavera Arrabiata, Falafal, Veg pita. Great pasta, pizzas!  Family friendly and prices will not break your family budget.   This is the most authentic Mediterranean restaurant/diner in Ithaca.",
            "Thanks so much for your kind words. Appreciate it thanks so much",
            "Always a treat.  Elizabeth always treats us well.  Greek salad served family style is delicious.  Love the Souvlaki special and Moussaka.  Always take home a piece of Baklava too!",
            "Thanks so much really appreciate it!!",
            "Great Greek/Italian restaurant. The salad is very simple - I recommend not ordering it individually. The pizzas are great! Try one of their specialty dishes named after landmarks in the area!",
            "Fantastic! The staff is really great and the lasagna is to die for. Whatever you do, make sure to get their fresh bread with your order!",
            "Food was great. Not a fancy place, but the lamb  souvlaki plate was delicious.  Wife says her gyro was \"awesome \" and it huge!",
            "Glad you liked everything appreciate it",
            "Best Greek food in Ithaca. Staff is so friendly and accommodating and remember you if you come back. Reasonably priced and bigger than normal portions. Favorite restaurant in Ithaca",
            "Disappointing. Moussaka was dry, B\u00e9chamel crust was thin, very little eggplant. Gyro platter - a ton of meat slapped on a pita with tzatsiki sauce and nothing else... you see the plate and it looks just like a sea of mystery meat. No attempt to make it look appealing. Side salad was mostly iceberg lettuce with vinegary dressing. Lasagna - unremarkable.",
            "\ud83d\udc4d \u2026",
            "A little disappointing compared to the 4.4 rating if I'm being honest.  Server was nice, breads were excellent, but the meat and lettuce seemed to be low quality.",

            "This used to be my favorite place in Collegetown until I saw one of the cook grabbing pasta from a bin with his bare hands (without any gloves) into the pan. Therefore, for hygienic reasons I do not recommend this place.",
            "Thanks so much appreciate it ps  just read all your notes we use wax paper to get the pasta if not gloves. I want to believe that it was done that way and I will get to the bottom of this. I want to believe that my employee wouldn\u2019t do that or maybe you made a mistake. Thanks",

            "Food was good, they nickle and dime you on everything, $2.50 for anchovies (5), 3.50 for extra tzaziki sauce. Before you know it, what you think maybe a reasonable place to eat becomes pretty expensive.",
            "Thanks for the review we are happy you liked your meal. I understand but unfortunately we have to charge minimum possible for any sides as a small business we don\u2019t have any breaks on buying goods like bid chain restaurants that buy big orders. Appreciate everything",

            "It was good, but not great. I had the chicken parm which was pretty good. My wife had chicken soulvaki plate which was ok and the kids had a cheese pizza which was also ok. Service was great. The waitress was very nice.",
            "Very friendly staff, and great prices for lunch.\n\nI almost always get the chicken souvlakia plate, and would recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent meal.",

            "I have been to Koko a couple times and tried Bibimbap with Calamari as well as Budae Jigae with ramen. It gets the job done for Korean food craving, but not as great as the reputation of the best Korean restaurant in Ithaca. The calamari bibimbap had a lot of lettuce in it, which made it almost like a salad. The budae jigae could have more ingredients in it. The side dishes are not bad at all.",
            "The owner was soso nice!! Love the new cafe reminded me of korea",
            "The Korean fried chicken is delicious, and their other Korean dishes are fantastic too",
            "I had Budae Jjigae, and it was not bad. But the amount of sausages and hams in the soup jjigae was slightly disappointing.",
            "Was excited to bring my older parents here as they weren't really hungry but wanted to try some good Korean food. We ordered a dish to share and something to take away. The owners didn't seem too happy that we didn't order massive amounts of food, and because my parents were feeling cold we asked for some hot water. I asked twice, and they still didn't bring it out even though it wasn't terribly busy. All in all, I was very disappointed with the service and are now hesitant to go back, especially with visitors.",
            "Came here for a group field trip for dinner and had an excellent meal here. Service here was quick and easy and prices seem reasonable compared to other Asian places that I\u2019ve been to. Our food we all enjoyed are meals and we really liked the overall presentation of them, especially the meals with eggs.",
            "Excellent service. Got the Soondubu Jjigae, bibimbap and chicken wings which were mostly pretty descent. Only miss was just that I felt the tofu stew could use a little more seasoning.",
            "Not sure why this is only 4 Star. Food was super delicious! The bibimbop was really good but the other dishes were amazing. The ramen was nice and spicy. The udon noodles were 5 Star. The best of all what the pancakes. So delicious we ordered seconds.",
            "FANTASTIC red sauce chicken wings, genuinely easily some of the best wings ive ever had.\n\nrest of the food ive had is also good.\n\nnice little spot, only complaint would be that the service felt a little rushed",
            "This place is amazing! Don\u2019t be turned off by the mediocre review (I seriously don\u2019t understand why), best Korean food in collage town.",
            "Love this place. Staff is nice. Dining room is clean. My mother has very restricted diet and even she is able to find something good to eat here. Big variety of Korean favorites and the food is always fresh and delicious",
            "Service is extremely attentive and fast even in during their busy dinner rush. The staff is helpful with explaining the menu and the food was served at our table within minutes. Great menu to choose from and the food was delicious.",
            "I still dream about this place 10 years later. The Ra Boki is one of the best meals I\u2019ve ever had",
            "Probably the best Korean food in Collegetown. Service is pretty quick and the servers/owner are very friendly.\n\nThe food is very affordable (especially if you're used to prices elsewhere like NYC's ktown) and pretty tasty. I can't find daeji bulgogi the way this place makes it anywhere else.\n\nThe only downside is the portions are a little bit on the small side and the meat I've had here tasted a little overcooked. But when you consider the lack of decent food in Ithaca, this place is definitely a winner.",
            "Disgusting restaurant.  They have a sign on their bathrooms that says delivery drivers cannot use the restrooms here. This is so unprofessional and unethical as a business to do. Delivery drivers are the backbone of America and there are million dollar contracts in place bringing these places business and money, so in theory delivery drivers are customers as well. This is horrible for any business to do, let alone to people they have to establish rapport with and collaborate with on a daily basis. Disgusting.  No one should ever dine here until they learn to treat drivers better",
            "Not bad food for where you are. Spicy pork was nice. Chicken katsu is OK. Service is OK.",
            "The tofu's quality is unacceptable to me. Like, I know that the price is just average, and not cheap, but I might even get better quality tofu with food trucks which would be less than half the price of what I paid here. The side dishes are decent though.",
            "I ordered take away Galbitang. It was served with rice  and banchan. Everything was delicious!",

            "I've been here twice now and I'd say it's met my expectations both times, but never exceeded them. I got a spicy seafood bibimbop that was actually spicy (thank goodness) but honestly did not have much other flavor aside from the spiciness. I would completely understand if someone who does not like spice end up very disappointed.\n\nHowever, pricing is very fair. Service was average - I was not blown away (it took a while for them to come refill our water).\n\nFeels like an average Ithaca asian restaurant - it's okay.",
            "Even open on Memorial Day. Good service, good food, fair price. Just the owner isn\u2019t fluent in English. But that\u2019s all right, nothing goes wrong with the ordering!",
            "Extremely disgusting that you will not allow food delivery drivers access to the restrooms. You make us sit and wait for the order when you should have had it ready before we get there (not supposed to be after) and we are getting the food over to your customers on your behalf. We are like an employee to you! Do you not allow your employees to use the restrooms too?!? I highly recommend to find a different restaurant  to eat at. And drivers, I recommend to never accept an order from this place. I was a customer too and will never be again.",
            "Great Dolsot Bimimbap!!  Nice service, nice atmosphere!  There's a reason why this place is always busy!  Delicious and reasonable prices!",
            "Ambiance is good, plates and utensils are good. Service is quick, little portions of Korean appetizers were fresh, food is delicious, portion is reasonable, and prices are good. Will definitely go back and would recommend to anyone deciding whether to go or not.",
            "The food is very good, can get busy during lunch during semesters. One of the best in the collegetown!",
            "The quantity was adequate, but it was lacking in spice despite asking for a spicy dish to be made extra spicy. I could not taste any spice at all, but the flavor was fine outside of that. They include full tip on carryout which is fine, but that was not stated at any point during the transaction even when their system prompts you for an additional tip.",
            "Good food, but can get a bit pricy.",
            "Great food and good service! Loved it. Definitely going to come back \ud83e\udd17 \u2026",
            "Very good food and very good deal. Like their fried chicken wings and the Korean food is very authentic. Strongly recommend",
            "I do not recommend this place at all! The food is decent, but the employees/owners can be downright rude, unaccommodating, and extremely unprofessional. They got my order wrong four times in a row over the span of a couple of weeks, despite me clearly stating my allergies/dietary restrictions when I placed the order. I didn't say anything the first three times. When I called to inform them that they had gotten my order wrong again, they deflected the blame and said that they were \"busy\" and that my order was annoying to make because of the modifications. The owner was rude and short with me and told me she couldn't continue our conversation because it was getting too busy. I called again after waiting about half an hour (when she told me to), but she forced an employee to take the phone call because I'm guessing she didn't want to speak to me. I could hear her getting angry and yelling in frustration at the employee in the background because I asked for a refund and they refused to give it to me, lying and stating that their payment system didn't allow for refunds unless they had the credit card with them. When I offered to bring the credit card in, the owner told the employee to say that they couldn't offer me a refund because of \"COVID restrictions\". This didn't make sense to me at all - what COVID restrictions were they speaking of exactly? This has been one of the most packed dine-in restaurants in Collegetown throughout the entire pandemic... it doesn't seem like they are taking too many precautions. I've been a customer for almost four years, but I won't be coming here again.",
            "Delivery drivers are not allowed to use your restroom? Maybe we should contact the health department about this practice. Unbelievable that you would discriminate against somebody because of what they do for a living not to mention they bring revenue and exposure to your store. You should be ashamed of yourselves.",
            "The amount of food it gives to delivery is at most 1/2 of the amount it serve in door at the same price.  I just feel angry to spend nearly 40 dollars to buy just 3  small pieces of beef and pork,  ramen and several scallion pieces with 2 small box of rice. If it is that easy to earn money why people are still studying?",
            "The owner is nice but the guy who works at the cashier is rude and unprofessional. I am the frequent customers of Koko. (Come to koko at least 4 times a week) The first time that guy didn\u2019t tight the take out bag which made it drop on the ground. The soups leaked. So I asked him to remake it and I would pay it again. He refused me at once. The owner was in the kitchen she heard it and told me to wait a second. I totally understood that there were other orders in front of mine. So I waited and got my dishes again. And this same thing happened again. The same guy he didn\u2019t tied the take out bag and it dropped on the ground. And he refused to remake it even if I paid again. There was 0 people in the store. (It passed the lunch time) and there were only 2 receipts on the cashier which means there were only 2 take out orders now) I had issues with that guy two times in a row. Next time I won\u2019t come to koko if I know he is working. Again the owner is really nice. And food is good. This review is about that staff.",

            "We help you make money and this is how you treat us?? Never again will I ever go there don\u2019t care how much money it will be. Also  the way you guys spoke to me was very unprofessional. Is plenty other restaurants to choose from that do treat their driver\u2019s with respect.",
            "Got takeout through Ithaca to Go from here.\nOrdered Champong, which is a seafood soup (usually has shrimp and squid, as well as pork, as far as I can tell). So by \"seafood\" I assumed they meant multiple kinds of fish/shellfish/etc., since normally restaurants will simply tell you what kind of animal is in something if it's only one kind and then use the term \"seafood\" to mean multiple animals.\nTurns out they only meant octopus. The one seafood I don't like. No other animals.\n\nGave much smaller portions than eat-in. Left us wondering if they were running out of ingredients, as the other 2 people who got food also had... less than expected. I wish they/the delivery person would have let us know ahead of time so we could have changed our orders or went for another restaurant (especially because ordering it through Ithaca to Go made it really expensive). Very disappointed.",
            "Firstly, lots of food are served. Jam-pong was awesome and bibimbap was good.\nSecondly, people in the restaurant were kind and nice.\nFinally, price was reasonable. As quantity was great, I did not feel that price was expensive.",
            "I was served in wrong order, twice, in one lunch. I am not sure if they were intentional. I knew they were busy and I'm not complaining about long waiting. But menu was given to me after a white woman arrived 5 mins after me got one. Water and sides are served later after her too, even I complained. They said sorry for the long waiting but not answer why I am served in different order twice. Sorry, a tiny can beverage, and a tip free bill are all they offered. Sorry, my offer is an entry in my blacklist.",
            "The place has changed after perhaps the boss took over the serving process. Very little quantity of the bimbap rice and the tofu stew soup, almost no veggies in both cases..And I tried to tell the waiter about this, who told me that he's the boss and that the menu says clearly that the real dish could differ from the pictures on the menu...When I asked for more rice, he said he has to charge me extra money--he barely gave me anything in the bowl! Really really a rip-off imo. It was not like this at all last semester...but it's changed over the summer. Won't go again!",
            "Cafe is super great!",
            "i ordered a sweet spicy chicken. They served me fried batter without any trace of meat in it. They rip you off by not putting in the full amount of food/ingredients. I can't believe they have the audacity to serve the dish that way and then charge you full amount. I was starving after the meal and had to go buy another meal somewhere else. Instead of helping me reduce stress during exam period with a good traditional Korean meal, this restaurant caused me more stress.",
            "honestly my #1 pick for Korean in CTown. staff is always very friendly. my go-to is soondubu, which I think they do best in CTown. solid familiar flavors in the dishes, which I super appreciate. also the hidden gem of the steamed egg appetizer \u2014 essentially gyeran jjim \uacc4\ub780\ucc1c \u2014 is super cheap ($3 or so) and can act as its own entree, if you\u2019re in a pinch. my favorite of their banchan is the potatoes and broccoli, which they seemingly always run out of. :-)\n\nedit, as of october \u201819:\nseems as though the quality of the food is going down. service is spottier, and a lot of the flavors seem off or lacking. i mentioned the soondubu earlier, but these days, it\u2019s been very comparatively disappointing: bowl not filled all the way, sometimes not bubbling and just warm (should be served boiling hot), very bland. in the words of my partner, \u201cit tastes like spicy nothing\u201d. also, we\u2019ve experienced several separate order mixups; just today, we received a budaejjigae instead of the soondubu that we ordered. i\u2019m sad i had to downgrade my 5 star review.",
            "Total disappointment! There was a BUG in the soup, who knows if it was tofu or chicken in the soup and the tempura shrimp came with 2 shrimp that were disgusting! We will never eat here again, what a waste for money!",
            "I had the salmon teriyaki -- it was pretty good, but the sauce it was in was a bit too salty. The rice on the side was tasty though!\n\nCovid update: very packed; would not recommend dining in.",

            "Really bad food. Rude staff. And they don't let delivery drivers use the restroom even though we help them make money for there restaurant. Wouldn't recommend",
            "I used to order their sundubu for lunch to go because it was awesome and filling. I've noticed in the last year that they've been downsizing, but keeping the prices the same. The sundubu was literally barely half-filling the container today, and when I brought it to the server's attention, she just denied it and said that it's full, even though we were both looking at it. Either we were looking at different containers, or she was delusional. This goes for their panchans (side dishes) as well. This is too bad, because the actual flavor of the sundubu is great, it's just not worth the money anymore.",
            "Food is pretty good and the service is also good.  I love their jajangmyun (brown noodles) & champon (spicy soup noodles).  Their chapchae is one of the best I have had at a korean restaurant outside of New York or Los Angeles.\n\nThe only reason I am not giving 4 stars is their take out foods.  More specifically, they appear to shrink the portions dramatically when you order takeout even though the price is the same.   For example, their soybean paste soup fills less than a third of the takeout container.  At those portions, the dishes are about 50% MORE EXPENSIVE than Korean takeout in NYC.\n\nThis is the second best korean restaurant in Ithaca.  Just avoid takeouts.",
            "The food was really good. The owner was the friendliest person I've seen in collegetown. The service was fast and friendly. Get the rice punch!",
            "Decent food, average prices, but i asked for ddok bukki and they overcooked it, so i told them and they said they\u2019d redo it. It came back probably 30 seconds later just as sad. It almost seemed like they just gave me the same plate of ddok bukki :(",

You do get large portions, and they are really accommodating if you want modifications, which is a big help since I\u2019m Vegan. The main issue for me is the slow service. The text alerts always say 45 minutes no matter when I order, and it\u2019s almost never ready on time. I spent over an hour waiting in-store once for soup. But again, you gotta be reasonable with the expectations. It\u2019s not fine dining, so I think you get your money\u2019s worth.",
            "So yummy! We were pretty impressed. The host said the food would be 20 minutes and it came out on time and cooked fresh. Happy with our chicken broccoli bento and orange chicken bento. The crab Rangoon had more cream cheese than actual crab but still tasty. I loved my Shumai. Super satisfied with this spontaneous stop here.",

Only downside is there\u2019s always pesky gnats, aka baby flies, flying around, at least during the summer. I wish Fusia Bento Bar had countermeasures put in place to get rid of them.",

Not bad, just not exciting.",

The design of the newly renovated dining area is so cozy and warm. The new owners are friendly and professional. I got the handmade buns and a General Taos Bento. All of it was carefully made with quality. The buns are to die for honestly. I like that they have traditional Asian and American Asian food.

Thus when we opened the bag and started eating the soup seeped out of the bag really fast onto the table, causing possible water damage to my friend's laptop.

I really love the ginger garlic-ish sauce served on the Hainan chicken dish. Recommended to those who want to experience authentic rich flavor Vietnamese food !!",

            "As a local Vietnamese, I can say this is the worst Pho I have ever tried for my whole life. It's not even Pho. It's some kind of noodle with poor soup. I think the chef/owner is not even Vietnamese too. I don't normally give bad rating to others, but I think the owner should change their restaurant's name, and the menu name. Don't call it Pho and don't make people think that Pho is something that bad.",

            "The most interesting feature of the restaurant is it is connected directly  to the Chinese restaurant next door. Pho time shares the kitchen and staff with the Chinese restaurant.  As such, your time to receive service depends on how busy both sets of restaurants are. At the lunch time, the kitchen was probably overwhelmed and we waited approximately twenty minutes after ordering for our four bowls of pho to show up.  The soup seems a bit light for what I am used to and the beef was overcooked.",
            "This might not be a pho restaurant so my review might seem overly harsh.  With that in mind the positives are that they are fast and fairly priced.\n\nThe pho was a severe disappointment though.  The toppings normally are put on the side but were placed on the soup, possibly to hide poor freshness.  The sprouts were insufficient in my opinion and the lime was in the soup so I had to pull it out to squeeze it while hot.  The noodles seemed over cooked and the soup tastes off.  Big disappointment, I didn't finish it.",

            "My husband got the number 1 pho. Really terrible meat quality. I got the shrimp pho, there was no treatment to the shrimp at all, it was like it was just taken from the freezer bag and tossed in. Definitely do not recommend.",

            "Not as spectacular as Vietnamese/pho restaurants in NYC but as restaurants in Ithaca go, this is one of the best. I haven't ordered a single dish here yet that I didn't enjoy. The pho is well done, very flavorful broth, just what you're looking for if you're having a pho craving. I've also had the vermicelli, which is perfectly refreshing and has a great balance of meat (and tofu), vegetables, and rice noodles. The duck over rice also has a great sauce but the duck is on the more fatty and tough side.\n\nFast service, not expensive, love exploring the menu here, all in all, great!",
            "I actually like the food there, but I never actually feel welcome whenever I go eat there. Always seems like they try to kick me out even before I'm done eating.\n\nDoes anyone else get the same treatment or it's just me?",

            "My dad and I have been regulars at this restaurant for as long as I can remember. We pretty much always order the same thing: steamed pork dumplings, sometimes fresh rolls, and a BBQ pork pho, all of which are amazing. Also, since we\u2019ve been going here for so long, when we come in the owner always knows what we want. If flavor is the main thing you\u2019re looking for, the pork pho is the way to go because the broth is packed with spices and delicious herbs. I also recommend going for lunch and ordering off of the dim sum menu, which comes from Hai Hong, the restaurant next door. All in all, this place is very authentic and you won\u2019t find and thing better or cheaper in Ithaca.",

            "Expensive, $9 for a small bowl of Pho.  Only one size but I would consider my bowl small.   For some reason my noodles where chopped up and all the fresh vegetables where already added to the soup when It arrived at the table(lettuce?(why) and bean sprouts, no vietnamese basil).  Quick service and It tasted OK but I have had much better for less.",
            "People who come here expecting Saigon Kitchen will be dissapointed.  This restaurant caters to collegetown folk (ie. students) and provides decent-quality food with reasonable prices and speed.  The portions are not huge but one serving fills me instead of bloating me.  I would recommend the meat rolls (#10?) as an appetizer and any of the pho as well (avoid the roast duck, comes with many bones).",
            "Spring rolls were nasty, pho was very disappointing, and saw a cockroach on the wall. Ended up throwing up everything and my stomach is very upset. Definitely not ever going back. This is a \"Vietnamese\" restaurant ran by Chinese.",

An offshoot of the family's primary businesses \"HaiHong\" (which can be accessed through an arch and whose dimsum can be ordered either side) Vietnam Restaurant focuses on fast, solid Pho and noodles.\n\nExcellent toppings, tender meat, and while the broth is not as elegant as some places, it's a great place for a bowl of noodles without wasting an afternoon it breaking the budget.\n\nBeer and juices as well as excellent tea to accompany your meal, prompt service and clean bathrooms. :)",
            "They call themselves a Vietnamese restaurant but they make better Chinese food than Vietnamese food. Their dim-sum and canto food in general is very high quality. No.1 place for Chinese food in college town for me.\n\nOwner is friendly and welcoming too!",

            "Not a lot of vietnamese options in Ithaca, but this is definitely not the place to go for the good stuff. For some reason, they served the Pho with the optional ingredients (sprouts, basil, etc) already in the soup, very odd in my experience. The broth wasn't very good either. Service was poor even though it wasn't busy. Head over to Saigon Kitchen instead.",
            "Food was a good price.\nPho broth wasn't very flavorful and all the stuff that usually comes on the side came inside the bowl already.",

            "We've eaten here so many times that we barely need to order. Joe Luu, who runs the restaurant, remembers our favorites, and he's like this with lots of other people, too! We love the food, Joe Luu, and the other staff!",

            "It was just okay. I ordered the steak burrito, with fries in it. The fries were really dark and greasy, and all I could really taste in the burrito was oily fry and sharp cheddar. The burrito was really big, so that was good, but it was also expensive. I ordered the one burrito, and a side of guac and my order was almost $30. The guacamole was bland, tasted like smashed avocado and lime and not much else. It was really fresh tasting though! I did REALLY enjoy the sauces. The medium sauce was so creamy and flavourful, and the hot sauce was the same, but also smoky which was great. I didn't like the mild salsa.\nNot the restaurants fault, but a heads up, parking was atrocious.",
            "We're sorry to hear you didn't enjoy everything. We're committed to making sure all our customers are left feeling satisfied and we'll do anything to make sure that happens. Please send an email to the owner (jorge@dosamigosfood.com), so we can see if there's anything we can do to make it up to you (including giving you our salsa recipe)",
            "The blandest burritos I have ever tasted. Also overpriced. There was once even a bone in my ginuswine burrito which could have easily broken my tooth (although they compensated me for this). However, another time I cashed in my 20 reward points for $34 off my order, but my order amounted to only $20. I assumed the remainder would be saved in my balance, but it just erased it all. I want my $14 back.",
            "Dos Amigos does not disappoint. I was visiting Ithaca from Rochester and stopped at Dos Amigos. Since I had never been there, I wasn't sure what to order, but the owner was super friendly and suggested the tacos-- each with a different choice of meat so I could have a taste of everything. I am so glad that I trusted him because the tacos were AMAZING. My favorite taco was the carnitas (still thinking about it). I learned from the owner that their spicy, green sauce is freshly-made. I love hearing when a place puts in that extra effort for their customers. It just makes the food taste even better. I highly recommend Dos Amigos and I highly recommend getting the tacos. I will definitely be returning in the future.",

Normally burritos are not my favorite menu item, but the dos amigos burrito is a game changer. My favorite burritos ever. They lightly grill the outside of the burrito wrap so that it\u2019s not mushy, and the fillings are fresh, delicious, perfection. It has french fries in it too, which is totally genius. The food takes a little time because it\u2019s fresh made, but it\u2019s worth the wait.",
            "Let's get this out of the way - the food here is amazing and always my go to place for burritos.

I let you enjoy finding out. Anyway, this is an amazing place to eat and highly recommend!",

From the moment I walked in, the lively ambiance and welcoming staff set the stage for an unforgettable culinary adventure.\n\nLet's start with the star of the show: the food! I ordered the Lauryn Grill steak burrito and the Pig Boi pork shoulder quesadilla, and both dishes were absolute game-changers. The flavors were rich, authentic, and simply mouthwatering. The beef in the Lauryn Grill burrito was tender and perfectly seasoned, while the pork in the Pig Boi quesadilla was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Dos Amigos' commitment to using high-quality ingredients truly shines through in every bite.\n\nNow, let's talk about the salsas. Oh boy, they are a force to be reckoned with! Dos Amigos takes their salsa game seriously, offering three options that elevate the dining experience to a whole new level. The salsas complemented the dishes impeccably, adding an extra layer of zing and heat. They were so good that I couldn't resist asking for extra servings to savor every drop.\n\nBeyond the delectable food and salsas, the service at Dos Amigos was outstanding. The staff members were attentive, knowledgeable, and passionate about their craft. The friendly and energetic atmosphere made me feel right at home.\n\nThe portion sizes were generous, leaving me completely satisfied. The restaurant itself is clean and comfortable, creating a vibrant and inviting space to enjoy a meal with friends.\n\nDos Amigos is a true gem when it comes to taco restaurants and I can't wait to return for another flavor fiesta!",
            "I\u2019ve never written a bad review about a restaurant in my entire life. But paying $75 for three peoples meals and drinks, leaves me feeling disrespected about how bad this food was. It was salty like someone had dumped the ocean into my mouth. The chips were stail, the burritos were filled with stail and greasy french fries, the margarita was weak and tasted more like sugar than anything else--all of this list left me disappointed because I had read one review that said this was the best Mexican food in the region. The food was not authentic at all and the kid behind the counter making the food was on his phone the entire time which made us wait 25 minutes being the only people in the restaurant, I would not wish my worst professor to ever eat here. I would literally swim through an ocean filled with shark-infested waters with steaks tied around my neck, kickbox an entire village of Thai fighters, and lay in a bathtub filled with glass just to never eat the salty disgusting food ever again.",
            "They ONCE had great tacos (esp if you like cilantro) despite the shop being the pricest in town. However, they've now increased the price still further ($6+ for ONE taco) with spectacularly decreased food quality.\n\nThe beef taco I ordered 1) had no steak stripes as they used to but only small pieces of beef 2) was EXTREMELY salty and were barely swallable, 3) had a VERY poor selection of ingredients inside--cilantro, white onion, and beef that's all - - the tacos anywhere else, at Cornell Statler Diner Hall, at the other collegetown burrito shop, at Moe's, at Chipotle --all had many more nutritious ingredients, such as corn, lettuce, cream cheese, and so on... - - AND at a much lower/more reasonable price! 4) allowed for no alternative choice of tortilla. I dislike corn-based tortilla and would always go for a flour base. All other places I've visited would ask about the type of tortilla I'd want but not this place. I was unpleasantly surprised that corn tortilla was used...\n\nIn general this shop has served the historically pricest and least tasteful and least nutritious taco I've ever had in my life. Would not visit again. It's unfortunate that they are at such a central and convenient location and yet offers no good experience to customers at least imo. I'd give 5 stars still to customer service and environment : but seriously food quality and value for money are far more important than these other peripheral considerations.",
            "My friend and I both felt unwell after eating, the burrito was full of weird taste beans and I couldn\u2019t finish it, not to mention the 20 min wait time, overpriced as well",
            "The food I got has always been to go. The food itself is good, but it definitely is not as cheap as I wish, but that's what you will get in collegetown/ downtown Ithaca. I have always gotten a burrito of some sort, and have yet to be disappointed.",
            "Holy ****! The hot salsa is amazing and sweat-inducing haha! The meals were delicious and filling. The staff were very kind and the food is cooked fresh :)",
            "My favorite taco restaurant! The meat flavor and salsas are very out of this world. I haven\u2019t tried a taco like this anywhere else! Highly recommend.",
            "I ate at Dos Amigos last week and did not have the best experience from a service standpoint. And while everyone has an off day - it is what you do that separates the good organizations from the not-so-good organizations. Dos Amigos followed up with a (non-public) survey and responded to my feedback. First, they actually read my survey. Second, they genuinely seemed interested in my comments and trying to make the situation right. Listening to your customers and working to improve your service tells me a lot about an organization.",
            "Thank you for your review and feedback. We agree with your statements and take feedback seriously, it is the only way to improve.\nWe hope we have the opportunity to serve you again soon",
            "I went a few months ago and had the carnitas tacos and my friend got the chicken quesadilla. Both were amazing. The carnitas tacos are def my favorite item so far!",
            "Thank you for your review. I hope we have a chance to serve you again soon.",
            "Wow, I have never had a worse experience at a restaurant in my entire life. I walked in and the staff appeared to busy watching videos to notice me. When they finally did they were rude as I was ordering. I should have left then but I didn't. I ordered a Lauryn Grill burrito and chips and salsa. It cost over 20 bucks so I was hoping the food would be good because when you pay that much for a burrito you expect it would be good. I ordered it in store and they cut the burrito in half causing it to fall apart and I had to eat it with a fork. There was hardly any steak in it and what steak they did have was dry and tasteless. The only flavor in the burrito besides the tortilla was salt. I tried the chips hoping they would be properly salted but they were under salted oily and chewy. They also only gave out a tiny bag of chips. It wasn't even a quarter of the way full and they charged me 4 bucks for those and some \"salsa\" that was so liquidy it was not enjoyable to eat. Overall it was a horrible experience I WOULD NOT RECOMMENDED THIS TO MY WORSE ENEMY!!!!",
            "Hi Esmeralda, we appreciate your feedback. We value an honest review from a customer's perspective as it helps us improve all aspects of our customer experience.

            "We had the veg tacos and veg burrito. Veg tacos are literally just made of beans. BEANS. Nothing else. The burrito was tasteless. Shameful to serve something like this. My Mexican husband was appalled that this is sold under the guise of \u201cMexican food.\u201d Even as a non-Mexican I can\u2019t believe we just spent that much for a few handfuls of beans!",
            "Hi Diana,  we are disappointed to learn your experience wasn't as perfect as it should've been.

            "If you\u2019re seeking for an authentic Mexican flavor in a Taco, look no further. Doa amigos is the place you will go over and over! Highly recommended!",
            "Hands down my favorite mexican style resturant. the roast face killah and lauren grill are our faves. 10/10 would recommend. the homemade salsa is yummy! always a pleasant experience and good rewards program.",
            "Hi Tara, \n\nThank you for your review and for your business! We're happy to hear you like our restaurant. Hearing from customers like you always makes our day and we appreciate it! Cheers!",
            "Nice place, came in for one of their burritos for the first time and I was super impressed! I don't usually dine in college town so this was a pleasant surprise",
            "Most authentic So Cal Mexican in Ithaca from people from So Cal.",
            "I love eating at dos amigos. Good food (tacos are amazing), good atmosphere and location. However, my last experience which was today, was not good at all. The tacos were greasy, they changed their hot salsa or the texture of the sauce which caused the tacos to fall apart in my hands. I was left with a terrible stomach ache and truly regretting the order.",
            "Hi Zaira, we are sorry to hear your experience was less than perfect. We are terribly sorry that you felt sick after eating our food and that you feel as though are salsa is not up to par.

Please reach out to us over email at dosamigosfood@gmail.com so we can send you a reward. Hope to hear from you soon! All the best, Dos Amigos",
            "Very good food--I always get the chicken burrito (Slick Chick), which comes with a lot of stuffings like homefries and cilantro and beans. My friend really enjoys the tacos here, too. They also have some interesting Mexican drinks that I recommend trying out. The names for all the dishes are pretty funny, too, mostly based on rapper names (the bean burrito is childish gambeano for example).",

            "As a Mexican I must say that Dos Amigos has one of the best tacos I'ver ever tried. Everything off the menu is amazing, whether it's a simple quesadilla or a burrito, the quality is top notch. And the best part... you can chase all that food with a margarita ;)",
            "Thanks for your review, we hope to see you again soon",
            "I started coming to the taco truck my freshman year of college and haven\u2019t stopped even two years out of college! The food is amazing, the owner is a Cornell alum (support local!), and they now have a restaurant in Collegetown with margs! It\u2019s the first place I stop at when I go back to visit Ithaca!",
            "The Mexican food really hits the spot! The pork is a must try!!! Margaritas have some nice zip on them too. Best Mexican food I've found in Ithaca!",
            "The real Mexican flavor with a great selection of beers. Great place to be and enjoy Mexican style tacos.",
            "Love the steak burrito and the salsas! It is a 100% one of my favorite spots in Ithaca",
            "We were very excited to try Dos Amigos...what a letdown!\n\nTheir website says that they do pick up orders until 8:45. Went through the whole rigmarole of placing an order online at 8:15 because I couldn\u2019t get through on the phone, to have it tell me that they are no longer accepting orders.  They also completely trashed our dinner plans because the website said it would take 20 min, so we had waited to place an order.\n\nBe honest about when you are open!!!",
            "Hi John,\n\nThank you for your candid feedback. We're working on expanding our hours and increasing our service bandwidth, but there's a significant shortage of restaurant workers locally which has prevented us from reaching this goal. Occasionally we have to shut down web-site deliveries due to our team being overwhelmed with orders.\n\nWe regret your experience was not what you or us expect, and ask for you for your patience while we recruit and hire to improve.",
            "The taco of today is emblematic of that which is near Christ. Where is the MK arcade? Just like I remember",
            "Potentially the worst burrito i have ever had. Beware! A burrito should not taste like curry. The rice was over cooked and mushy. Seemingly no chicken at all to top it off. Would rather wait in the hour long line at chipotle.",
            "I've enjoyed Dos Amigos' food for quite a while now.  Today they delivered an order containing 5 items to my apartment 19 minutes after I placed the order on their website. I thought that was exceptional and it was time to leave a review.",
            "We're glad you enjoy our speedy delivery and deliciously authentic Mexican food!",
            "Ordered the pork braised shoulder burrito, the \u201cGinuswine\u201d. It was good. But had minimal meat,  which was disappointing. Kept wondering where the meat was with every bite. Mainly stuffed w beans and potatoes. Both salsas were on point. They should sell \u2018em by the jar. If they were to add more meat and less potatoes I think it would be a solid burrito. That\u2019s why this rating is 4/5 and not a 5/5.",
            "Hey Ana! Thank you for providing us with this feedback. We like to shoot for perfection in every bite with every burrito but there are times that we miss a beat. Our apologies. All of our burritos should have a minimum of 3.5 oz of protein, spread out through the length of the burrito so that every mouthful has that wonderful combination of textures, saltiness, acidity, and salsa heat. We would be honored if you gave us another shot at making that happen. Feel free to reach our to us directly at dosamigosfood@gmail.com so we can talk in more detail. Again, thank you for commenting. We recognize that you took time out of  your day to praise us, and help us get better, this means the world to us.  Be well, hopefully we get to  serve you in our store soon.",

            "You just can't go wrong with tacos",
            "I was really excited to try dos amigos, but was sadly disappointed. The burrito I got (the Slick Chick) was mostly beans and potatoes with very little meat and overall it was very bland. Maybe a different meat would have had more flavor.",

            "Very nice Mexican food. Shame it only opens in the evenings. They have very thicc burritos which actually fill you up compared to other restaurants close by.",

            "Hi Jesse, we agree using fries as the base is a game changer but we owe that to our roots in Sandiego where the California burrito started it all. Our hours are limited in part because of the market shift. At the moment we are operating as lean as we can to get through the winter but should be expanding into lunch/late night as we build up our team and see the market shift back up. Happy New Year !",

            "After a long day of hiking, then getting clean after we ran out of places to eat. Thankfully D.P. Dough was open at 11 and delivered our food. We ordered online and were unsure if they were really open (because we've never experienced a food place open so late)  but after a little while we got the call that the driver was at the hotel! They saved us and our poor empty stomachs. The calzones were really good too! We got a simple order and they were exactly what we needed. Definitely going to use them again now that we know they are open so late!",
            "I order for delivery pretty often , NEVER disappoint, always quicker than expected for delivery time , delivery drivers always really nice! and ofc food is always good !! Will definitely keep ordering from here \ud83d\ude0a!",
            "Ordered food from GrubHub, and it never came after an hour and thirty minutes of waiting! The person on the line only offered me a free milkshake in exchange for all that time. This isn't the first time this has happened, and I get my hopes up every time only to be let down. Calios ain't the move.",
            "There ghost restaurant Macman is gross and over priced. Less than half a bowl and bad Mac and cheese for $10? The cheesy tots looks great but are ehh. And the boneless wings are plain gross.",
            "The quality of the food is like 6 to 7 out of 10. However it's the only late night restaurant in town and they have great service, so that makes up for it. It's just good to have a food option available during the night.",
            "Ordered online via GrubHub for pickup and food was ready on time (this was at lunchtime while Cornell students were in town). Calzones were OK, not amazing but decent considering the price (about $8 each) and convenience. Each comes with a cup of marina sauce. Calzones are good size, not overly gigantic but definitely filling. Staff was friendly. They have about six vegetarian calzone options.",
            "First, I got the order an hour and a half after I ordered it. After eating the dunkers I took a bite out of my calzone and discovered it was a chicken parm rather then the Italian one I ordered. Bummer. I called the store and they did give me credit though. Always had good service from the DP dough in Huntington. Maybe I\u2019ll try this one again, but unlikely.",
            "I used to love dp dough its been around for ever but these people they have working for them are mad rude and disrespectful there delivery driver should not have her job.. I just cant believe the owner allows any of it.. I will never order from there again and def will never recomend anyone waste there money there",
            "Food was gas station quality, but service was good and they stay open real late.",
            "Friendly service, Fast orders, Good Sauce selection.\n\nOkay price ($9 per Calzone)\n\nBread is very doughy; feels like it's not cooked long enough. Only 2 calzones are vegetarian out of 20 options.",
            "These are the type of people that you want to make a calzone for you. Food was delivered fast, hot and delicious. We got two calzones, the garlic parm boneless wings and a Reese\u2019s dessert and everything was on the money. Thanks for showing us some love, dp dough!",
            "I ordered a calzone and the cheese sticks.  They were delicious.  The people working were very friendly and had my food out quickly.  Best food I\u2019ve had in awhile. Will be back soon.",
            "Ordered online and tried to call to let them know I would be 10 minutes late (I wish the app would let you select a pickup time).\nAfter being on hold for 10 minutes,  was given 100% attitude by an obnoxious employee. This person was rude and  compeletely disrespectful.  I told him that if I was that much of a bother that he could go ahead and cancel my order. I was hung up on before I could get the manager's contact info.  I put the odds at 50/50 that he actually credits my card back. I am a Cornell alumnus and have been a customer for 30 years. No longer... There is no reason why I should have been treated this way.\nTo the manager: you need to remind your employees why they are there.  The gentleman working the phone tonight is certainly not working with your best interests in mind.",
            "calzones are good and its super clutch to have someplace open late at night",
            "Those who return to DP Dough understand that there will necessarily be a light salting of disappointment as the grease-soaked carbs settle into the beer already occupying your tummy. Connoisseurs even seek it out. Somehow the calzonic anticipation leads to a perfect first bite but the rest somehow breaks the spell, creating a very /delectatio morosa/ feel. Under no circumstances should DP Dough be compared to fine dining, nor even to the Pizza Aroma half a block away; this is utilitarian fare, or cuisine to save a life: as like a tourniquet, not thrombolysis. For what it is as drunk food it succeeds quite well, lower in quality than a certain hot truck, but distinctive in that it comes to you where you are, rather than vice versa. Get a speed zone with ranch\u2014always get ranch; their marinara has remained consistently a tad too sweet across years of history in an attempt to build that reputation for that faint sense of unease that will so easily be forgotten by tomorrow's drunken carousing, when the story will repeat all over again.",
            "Thanks?",
            "Been ordering from them for years now and can honestly say they\u2019re one of the best, especially late night, restaurants around. Great Calzones as well as their other options. Always have had very pleasant experiences with the staff as well. They really go above and beyond, especially after midnight and even when it\u2019s been nasty out. Really an Ithaca staple.",
            "Calzones are good but not great. They definitely satisfy the craving and they have a lot of options! Staff has adequate service but not good. Prices are reasonable. A big plus is how nice and clean the interior is. It\u2019s modern and always well maintained.",
            "After my food was 30 minutes late I called to check on my order, waited on hold for 40 MINUTES, then I was told it was \"on its way\". So after another 35 minutes goes by I called back and was rudely told \"well the driver has more deliveries than just you\". My food finally shows up an hour and a half after the delivery time, and I was missing THREE bottled drinks and the straws for the 2 shakes I ordered. When I called to tell them I was missing drinks and straws I told \"we will get it to you when we get it to you\". Sorry not sorry, but if im going to pay almost $70 for an order I expect to have everything I ordered and not to be treated like im the problem when clearly someone can't bag up orders properly. And the manager Megan was who I spoke to, she was nothing but rude, short and snappy with me because I wanted the items I ALREADY paid for I stead of a refund (which according to other reviews isn't something I should hold my breath for).",
            "They must put cocaine in those calzones. How do you make a creation this good. The oozing cheese off the soft fresh bread crust dipped into the flowing marinara sauce. Ugggghhhh gimme a calzone now I demand. Also funny Ben Wyatt from parks and rec",
            "Good prices, great size, decent sauce, and nice and crunchy veggies (albeit they were a bit small). Pretty quick cook time too, although I was the only one in when I ordered. My biggest critique is that the dough is dry, and it doesn't have a nice chew. A calzone is all about the dough and sauce for me.",
            "Waited an hour and a half for my order to be delivered on a Monday night after midnight. When it finally arrived I realized neither of my calzones had any sides of sauce including the one I paid extra for. When I called to tell them, I was told \u201csorry we are very busy tonight.\u201d and that they won\u2019t be able to get the sauces to me. Offered a credit of .75 cents and then ultimately just $5 back. Complete waste of an order, as I don\u2019t know anyone who eats a dry calzone or pizza. I guess I will never order from here again.\n\nEdited to add that they never credited me any of my money back. Will absolutely never order from here again.",
            "I have loved DP Dough since my own college days at UMass Amherst 30 years ago.  The quality of calzones are even better now and I am never disappointed with an order. I love the addition of different calzones and the dessert choices are amazing.  I am, and will continue to be a lifelong fan!",
            "Seriously the best calzone I have ever had. People who work here are to the point and honest (no BS about wait times). Highly recommend the Bro Zone with jalape\u00f1os. Excellent stuff. Cannot recommend this place highly enough.",
            "Glad to hear you enjoyed it Joseph! Thank you so much.",
            "I've ordered you guys on and off for years ( I work nights).  Recently I lost my phone while doing some late night post-work dog walking on a sketchy block and somehow DP Dough Driver  (named Amanda) found it (and RETRIEVED IT FOR ME) by trying very hard to get the delivery done....HERO - 5 stars - I'd love to track this person down and make it up to her.",
            "Good calzones with a ton of selection.  This place is a staple to many in Ithaca, but I rarely find myself going or ordering.  Takes on average 10-20 min for orders, and they're open into the arse of the night so you can really get food anytime.  Check it out if you haven't already.",
            "Nathan,\nThanks for the review! We're looking forward to seeing you soon.",
            "Ate lunch at the Green St. location at least a handful of times a month. LOVED the End Zone - beef and onions and green peppers... so good! Franchise owner has opted to close that location in favor of one in Collegetown - somewhere I won't ever go for lunch, even if I did have enough time to get there on my break. It's a real shame. Still giving it 5 stars since the food is great. Just sucks they won't get my money anymore.",
            "DP Dough. Man. What can I say about this place? You come out of one of the pubs near commons after a night of drinking. It's late. And you are starving. All the pizza places near by are full to the brim with drunk undergrads. Head on town to this place. Not as full as other places. Calzones made hot and fresh. All the fat and flavour you need to keep that hangover away! Staff are pretty nice! But if you are intoxicated, all those things don't matter to you. If you are a vegetarian, I would recommend the Pesto zone.",
            "Bhargav,\n\nThanks for the 4-stars! Let us know what we can do to get a fifth star next time. Thanks!\n\nHave a great day!",
            "the food was fresh & hot and the workers were SO sweet",
            "Thank you Abigail!",
            "An Ithaca classic. DP Dough serves up the best, most fresh, customizable calzones along with some awesome cheesy bacon tots and an amazing calzone cheesecake concoction that I was hesitant to try but I'm glad I did. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is fun. If you pick up, call in your order, or use their website for online ordering you can get some good deals too. Great place to order pick up or delivery for anyone, especially broke college students",
            "So i've ordered from here a few times and they have consistently forgotten things like sauce, sodas and cheese (that's right, on a calzone).....oh, and also to respond about said issues, lol, nothing like getting ignored after giving someone money and not getting a complete order.\n\nTonight i sit here a full 2 and half hours after ordering and no food....made the followup call the they guy said it just left and sorry for the \"slight delay\"...seriously???? If ANYONE ELSE was open \"dupers\" would be out of business for sure....",
            "The food is not tasty, or cheap, or fast. Calios has no redeeming qualities. Their calzones are disgusting- the dough tastes like cardboard and the meats/cheeses are extremely gross. Would not recommend under any circumstances",
            "Sorry for the past rating! I did not mean to rate this in the first place (just wasn't going in and rating things at the moment). Staff are friendly and the calzones are great. I always like to go with a friend during Wednesday for 2 for $12 calzones. Tasty food and they're open late.",
            "Curtis,\n\nThanks for the review. What can we do better?",
            "Nope.  After hearing all the good things about D.P's Calzones from friends, I was super stoked to try them. But I was incredibly disappointed with the flavour of the food and I'm likely never going back. The service was okay so I'm giving two stars for that but Honestly after trying one of their calzones and realizing how awful, boring and dry it was. I just ended up making my own the next evening.",
            "Danita,\n\nThanks for the comments. We are sorry to have only earned two stars but your feedback can help us improve. It sounds like we had an off day and would like the chance to earn back your business. Would you be so kind to provide us with your contact info through this form: http://www.dpdough.com/index.php/contact-us/ ? Thanks! We look forward to getting you that awesome calzone you were expecting!",
            "Always friendly staff, and wonderfully delicious calzones. A very fun place to go with your friends, especially if you are looking for something filling very late at night. If you go on Wednesday, you can get 2 calzones for $12, which is their best deal. My favorite part though is the chalkboards everywhere, where you can doodle while you wait for your food or leave a message to the staff or the next people who stop by.",
            "Jaime,\n\nThanks for the great review! See you soon.\n\nBest,\nDave",
            "By far one of the best calzone places I have ever eaten at. Staff was extremely friendly and the menu was to die for. Will definitely go back when I'm in the area to eat there. You definitely get a value for your money!",
            "Christine,\n\nThanks so much for the great review! We look forward to seeing you again.",
            "this is my go to when i go to ithaca. arriving in ithaca at 1 am? no problem! dp dough has got you. i've had so many delicious calzones but i'm dying to try more flavors next time i visit ithaca",
            "Awesome to hear! Enjoy!",
            "One word describes these calzones, rubbery. Do not waste you're money on this god awful food. The prices are no different than anywhere else in Collegetown, and the food has zero redeeming qualities. Somehow this place even managed to make milkshakes taste bad. It was like having to drink the freezer-burned ice cream your aunt left in the fridge for seven months and forgot to throw out. Whether you're visiting Ithaca or live nearby, avoid this place. You're not missing anything.",
            "This was the first time I have gone to the new location! It is much nicer and definitely worth checking out. I have always loved their calzones and how late they're open. It is amazing to have a place to go after a nice of drinking or just ordering in when you are extra lazy.",
            "Thanks for the great review, Joe!",
            "Ya are the best last night snack every time I be drunk af at 2 am I can count on y'all. Every time I'm high as giraffe nuts because that Zaza be punching I can count on y'all to bring me my food at 3 in the morning I love y'all",
            "Terrible customer service, the employee behind the counter clearly wasn\u2019t interested in even taking the order, refused to acknowledge that there was a customer waiting, and when he finally did, acted like he was doing me a favour. Very rude, deliberately slow. Definitely skip this place!",
            "Excellent calzone with thin crispy crust. Really liked that it wasn't mostly bread with a little fillings. Good price for a huge portion. Next time I'm in Ithaca I'll be visiting.",
            "Lorne, Thanks for the great review. We look forward to seeing you the next time you are in Ithaca.",
            "I ordered a calzone at 8PM and it\u2019s now 10PM and I still haven\u2019t received it...I called many times to see what was going on, and the guy answering the phone was ridiculously rude. I just want my food! 2 stars cause I\u2019m hoping the food is good when it finally gets here.",
            "DP Dough is clutch.  Open until 4am, great selection, gets me through the weekend.  Usually delivers faster than they say too.",
            "Calios was a very unpleasant experience, to start I ordered a pound of wings, I was delivered a half pound, that was after a 10 minute issue with the driver delivering my wings. I then called the owner to see if i can get the order fixed and get my full pound, he then proceeded to say I was at fault becuase they didnt process my order correctly, not worth my time, probably not worth yours either.",
            "Ordered from here Monday night and found literal staples in the food. We called to ask about it and we're offered store credit. We will be avoiding this place from now on and I'll be warning everyone I know. This is unsafe at best and malicious at worst.",
            "The place is a takeout restaurant with a little bit of seating. The calzone was excellent, a crispy bite into the dough with sufficient fillings. The wings are baked not fried, so they aren't crispy. Off street free parking.",
            "Tracy,\n\nThanks for the 4-star review!! We look forward to seeing you again soon.",
            "DP DOUGH Ithaca has really upped their game. We have had 2x hot, well made, delicious calzones delivered ahead of estimated delivery time. The new manager,  Greg, is doing a great job!",
            "Thanks for the great review!!",
            "Filling to dough ratio is not consistent, and lately they haven't been putting any buffalo sauce on the buffer zone. The last 3 times I ordered a buffer zone it was just dough, chicken, mozz cheese and Bleu cheese. That combination is quite gross without buffalo sauce.",
            "Derek, thanks for the great review! The Buffer Zone is one of our favs, too.",
            "The food was ok, but they delivered my cinnamon stick dessert without icing and when I called to ask about icing, they said they ran out. It seems to me this is an essential part of the dish and they should have called to confirmed I wanted this inedible dessert. Of course the guy on the phone didn't offer a refund, but he did acknowledge that it is basically inedible... This was my first and last time ordering from D.P. Dough. The food was ok, as I said, but would they deliver a pizza without tomato sauce if they ran out of that too? All signs point to yes...",
            "I've been a roughly twice-a-month customer for over a year. That abruptly changed when I visited the website and it stated that my address is \"Out of Bounds.\" I live in Northeast Ithaca; I live 5 miles from DP Dough. I will not be ordering for pickup as the lack of convenience is simply no longer worth it for me to be a customer.",
            "Laura,\nThanks for the message. We were using a 3rd party for delivery. They had a larger delivery area. We recently brought our delivery service back in house. We have a smaller delivery area so we can offer better service to this area. Sorry for the inconvenience. We hope to see you soon.",
            "cal zone was way over cooked. It was so hard that we couldn't even cut it with there knife. When we told them about it, they just said they didn't know why it was so tough. I could tell it looked different from other times I ate there. Maybe they have new help? Not sure if I will go back. For 10.00 a Cal zone, it should be cutable!",
            "Excellent little food shop. The quality of the food was amazing.  We thought the service was also quick and very friendly.  The facilit6was kept clean and in very good condition.  We thought it was pretty nice that they stay open until 4am!!!",
            "The calzons are very delicious and hot. The staff is wonderful. They have the best desert I have had in years. The dough was fresh and the calzons where made right in front of you.",
            "Amazing food, the employees are very nice and considerate, very customer oriented especially the Master Chef Greg, he knows what he is doing and knows what the customers want. Very friendly and all around great guy. Highly recommend eating here.",
            "Sara,\n\nThanks for the great review and your visit!!",
            "The employees seem to be great, my order was accurate, and put together as best as can be. However, the ingredients are terrible. The marinara makes Ragu taste like homemade italian.\n\nThe garlic parm bites are literally pieces of puffy bread, zero seasoning.\n\nI'd rather be hungry, to be honest.",
            "Ithaca DP Dough\nI wouldn't even give one star but you have to, to make a review. Beyond burnt, dried out, not good at all. Big waste of money!! I won't buy it again at Ithaca DP Dough!\n\nCortland DP Dough is very good though.",
            "Won't answer restaurant phone for by phone delivery orders, forced to go through GrubHub. Wait time 30-40 mins, would have been 4:40 pm, then received GrubHub message estimated delivery time 4:55-5:05. Thats tolerable. It's now 5:20 and I have not received my food. There is not even college students in town.",
            "Best calzone I've ever had. They have friendly employees, an approachable atmosphere, and amazing food. Very high quality \"sometimes foods\".",

            "Give us another call! We will be more than happy to assist you, just need date and time of order. And the call center can forward you straight to us!",
            "Love the food,  great staff,  always energetic! I'm also really enjoying the lunch special,  who wouldn't want a free drink with their calzone!? Keep it up Calios!",

            "Fresh tasting calzone.  It can be made to order right in front of you. I made a mistake on the app. They were not sure what I wanted so they called me to verify. Great customer service",
            "At first it was great food. As I started to order more frequently, the delivery would come almost a hour later then expected and my order would be semi warm.",
            "Calzones made me see the light that is in all things. We are all connected on a deep, spiritual level, and calzones can show you that with just one bite. Before, I was a mess. Drugs, crime, tattoos; all things that were cleansed from my life by D.P Dough's calzones. Thank you, Greg for making each night better than the last. Our time spent together was always followed by calzones. This place is the shrine to all that is pure. All hail the cheese, all hail the sauce, all hail the dough.",
            "Tasty food and amazing service.\nWho doesn't love a good DP?!",
            "Ordered from them throughout the years and they have steadily gone down hill.  If its late and you have no other choice, yea go for it.. But there are better places out there.",

            "Always hot & delicious. Never wait long. Order is always correct. Great customer service too!",
            "Oh yeah! If you want a quick bite get one of their custom calzones. Made fresh to order it will hit the spot.",
            "poor service, prices are steep for calzone. only good thing they have going for them is they are open late. NEVER GET WINGS so gross.",
            "Marley,\n\nWe don't offer pizza. Did you review the correct restaurant? Perhaps you intended to review the pizza place next door to us.",
            "Amazing place to get calzones, service was beyond great and helpful. Would recommend, 10/10. Great for all ages, especially college.",

            "As always, dp dough serves up a hot fresh yummy calzone, made when you order, and in your face 10 minutes later. My go to in ITH for dinner!",
            "Thanks, Dan!",
            "Walked in at 3:30 in the afternoon. There was no one around, the person washing dishes never even noticed I was standing there at the counter. The place was a mess with food and flour all over the counters and tables. I was disgusted and walked out after being unnoticed.",
            "Its good, fried fast food. They do many difffernt calzones from pizza to apple pie to cheescake. Definitely worth a try at least once.",
            "Great food, my food was amazing and the employees were very fast and friendly.",
            "Late night Ithaca classic. So many different and tasty and customizable calzone options, I recommend adding \"tots\" to your 'zone to make it extra good.",
            "Mike,\n\nThanks so much for the great review!",
            "We ordered two milkshakes and one calzone and it was two hours late . Cold as a brick and the milkshakes were melted and disgusting",
            "The staff is ALWAYS friendly , and the food is always good ! Anything you'd imagine  on a pizza, in a calzone! Plus the desserts are great!",
            "The staff, the food, the atmosphere everything was perfect!",
            "Really great and friendly service. Calzones are not massive in size (unless you get the 1lb size) which is nice for lunches.",
            "great place for a quick bite to eat. cheap and tasty comfort food. late hours are super convenient.",
            "Took over an hour and well past the estimated time,  had to go out and meet the delivery driver cause they couldn't figure out my address and they forgot an item in my order.",
            "I am not a calzone fan, unless it's from d.p. dough.  I love their calzones.  If you haven't tried one, do it.",
            "John,\n\nThanks for the great review!",
            "Great carry-out stop with lots of tasty options to choose from.  A little tough to find but worth the extra effort.  Google maps will get you there.",

            "Friendly owner. The calzone I had was pretty good. Would go back again if in Ithaca",
            "Thanks for the great review! We'll see you the next time you are in town.",
            "First bad experience here but damn... took a hour for a construction and a buffer zone when they said it'd b 20 mins. And one was soggy.",
            "This store is wack, their delivery is always late! Never again I will order from here don\u2019t do it to yourself!",
            "If you're from downstate, pay for double extra ricotta or you will be disappointed",
            "The Calzones are good but the staff don't always wear their masks...",

            "Great, original food. Didnt come off as the cleanest. Lots of flys too",
            "Bland crust, bland ingredients, and uninspired menu. Hotdogs in a calzone? Not worth the money.",

            "Jack's have had many remodeling over the months, yes you read that right, but this is the best one yet. A space where people can have a conversation while eating in a well lit environment.  The kitchen is not hidden behind walls anymore, thus you can actually see the cleanliness of where your food is being made.\nAs for price, it's expensive. They have a shorter menu now compared to before, which is good but I should be even more smaller. On a scale of 1 to 5, the food is a 3.5. They do have shakes and smoothie options available also.\nJack's changes staff like clockwork, it's to the point where you're not sure if the staff you're seeing serving you today, will be present next week.",

            "*Jack's Grill is a restaurant that I rank high for their delicious food and friendly service.* They have a diverse menu that caters to every need and will satisfy any kind of customer. The only downside is the price as it is quite high for the average consumer and the wait time. Nevertheless, the food is tasty and well worth the price and wait.\n\nIn addition to the food, I have to give credit to their staff as well! They have always been so friendly towards their patrons and are dedicated to improving their business and their practices which I highly commend.\n\nI can understand some of the negative reviews; not every interaction and meal will be right all the time. But I believe that Jack's Grill deserves 5 stars and I hope people continue to support this business for years to come!",

            "TL;DR This was by far the worst dining experience I have ever had. Extremely rude staff, expensive prices, long wait times, and poor quality food are what you will find here.\n\nSo I am ordering early Saturday after coming back into town late. Not much open around 1am, so I decided to try Jack\u2019s. I put in the order and said it will be ready in 20 minutes. I get there just around the time, and they said it is not ready.\n\nWhat I noticed off the bat that there were people waiting for items. It seemed like they had been waiting a while for shakes. That observation got me worried since I ordered a shake. I thought it might add to my wait time.\n\nSo I sit for a bit. I wanted to be patient since they seemed busy with orders. What started to offput me was that the front counter person was extremely rude. And not just rude once or twice, but rude to nearly everyone that came to ask her for something. She said multiple times that she was there since 11am. I understand the exhaustion and frustration, but that does not justify poor behavior towards customers at all.\n\nTime started to drag and I had been there for 15 minutes (over 30 minutes since I put in my order) I was thinking that surely my food would be ready soon or at the very least my shake. The front counter person was working on producing shakes. Eventually, she was almost done with the back order of shakes. After she inquired who else had ordered shakes and I was the only one that responded, she outright told me she was not going to make it. She said she would refund me. Though she did not follow through with that\u2026\n\nSo 30 minutes of waiting at the place, I get an email saying my order is ready. I tried to inquire about this with the front counter person, but she just disappeared. She was gone for a loooong time. When she finally got back to the front, she told me they were still working on my order.\n\nI wait longer. I am getting more upset. The faces of every other customer told a thousand words, and they all were based on frustration. I wait over an hour. I inquired again about my order, they said they were working on it. A couple of minutes later, the front counter person reached into the warmer and handed me my order with a quick sorry and walked away. So my food was ready for a long time, they just didn\u2019t bother to give it to me.\n\nThe food was awful. After a couple bites of my lukewarm chicken tenders, which were more like underwhelming chicken cutlets, I threw my order into the trash. I cannot believe I paid $30+ for a few items, including an $8 shake that I never received. Normally, I would want to give a local restaurant a second chance. But not this place. I advise anyone to consider any other restaurant before coming here. Jack\u2019s is in my opinion the worst restaurant in Ithaca.",
            "Every time I order delivery, there is always either an item missing, or an item wrong. However, this time was even worse. I ordered Mac and cheese and a chocolate milkshake. There was meat in the Mac and cheese even though I ordered it plain. But the kicker was that there were these white chewy things in the milkshake that I absolutely cannot figure out what they were. It almost looked like meat but not quite, but regardless, it was definitely not ice cream. Whenever I order, it gets delivered late, or doesn\u2019t get delivered, and there is always something wrong with the food.",

            "I had to wait 30 minutes for my food while others people got there\u2019s after like 5-10 minutes.

This time the Burger patties were dessert dry and no amount of sauce and pickles saved it. Also near the end of my meal I almost choked on butcher paper. I checked if it was from the packing paper that they lay in the take out box. Nope. Threw out the rest of the burger.",

            "I got the bacon cheeseburger with bbq and pulled pork on it and it was amazing. Super flavorful and juicy. The fries were really tasty, fresh and salted. The shakes were to die for. They have lots to choose from on the menu, as well as all day breakfast. The reason why I gave service a 2 star is because nobody is really present up front. As I was ordering, another gentleman was lightly yelling \u201chello\u201d to grab somebodies attention. The atmosphere was decent, in a nice college town surrounded by lots of food, shops, and people walking around about. If I could I would do a 3.5, but overall, I\u2019m okay with giving it a 4.",

A people can also hold a couple of cups of coca while taking a bag of burgers all in a riding box?

The correct order couldn't believe a vegan Burger. Could taste that good.  I ordered the samething along today with garlic fries the fries literally just had chunks of minced garlic and oil and pepper on top of it.  The Burger whatever the green stuff was was unseasoned and not edible all in all the only thing I could eat from my $21 order was the pickle will not be visiting again",
            "Waited 40 minutes for food that should take about 10-15. The spicy chicken sandwich I ordered wasn\u2019t even spicy, and was kind of dry. My friend ordered a burger that was super dry and chewy. And I went up to the counter to ask if my food was ready and they hadn\u2019t even grabbed my ticket when I placed the order about 35 minutes ago and said it would take about 5 minutes (which it did). The only good thing about the meal was the fries. There are a lot of better places in college town and Ithaca in general than Jacks that take less time and the quality of the food is better.",

Having worked in food service I usually reserve a lot of patience for slow order times, (They were slightly understaffed) but over an hour on what should be 5 minutes of work is just unacceptable.\n\nThe expo hid in the kitchen the entire time, only coming to the front to angrily shout completed orders. Any customer inquiry their orders time was met with some variation of \u201cWe\u2019re short staffed, it will take however long it takes\u201d. Usually said with a hint of passive aggressiveness that told everyone in the store that the staff had zero sense of urgency and lacked any respect for customer service.\n\nStore could use a total staff overhaul,  and tell the hiring managers to start enforcing drug screenings if they want good employees.",

            "Online ordering was easy enough, but the food  was super disappointing. The burger definitely seemed like a flat, frozen little patty, even though the burger I chose was supposed to have local beef. The other burger we ordered cost extra to add a patty and have it be local beef. It also had a chewy, thin little patty.. single, not double as requested. The first burger was to come with bacon, and no bacon. The first burger came on a whole wheat bun that was so hard it was inedible. The taste for both was \"meh\" at best. The fries seemed microwaved, but who knows. We ate some of them after popping them in the toaster oven at home. The staff was okay enough, but no presence, no hello or anything... Just came out to hand us our food. Definitely won't be returning. Had higher expectations. Seems like the menu is full of lies that cost a lot. It's too bad as we had a decent experience there in the past.",

I cannot remember the last time I ordered from here without having something missing. I try giving Jack's the benefit of the doubt each time considering their food isn't as bad as their service, but this final time I received none of the extra sauces I ordered and got the completely wrong order delivered to me.\n\nJack's response? Contact DoorDash and get a refund.\n\nNever again.",
            "To be clear, the lady that runs Jack's is quite pleasent, and has been incredibly nice whenever  I have ordered food. The new workers are , however, rude and incredibly slow. I have been told to 'be reasonable' after having to wait close to a half hour. They have also messed up my order several times, and refused to refund the order.\n\nThe food is fine, but be prepared for inadequate service, not getting what you ordered, and getting talked back to by the new staff.",

After an interminable wait (no one else was there!) for an expensive meal, the food was unexceptional. The only possible exception being the chocolate shake which despite being small for the price was pretty good after it melted a little. It seemed more like a block of ice cream at first. After we got the meal we had to request ketchup which would not have been a big deal but the counter wasn't staffed and it was hard to get the attention of the person in the kitchen.",

            "The best milkshakes in town.   Very nice and creamy, malty.   Have ordered delivery food as well and always tasty.",
            "After three visits, they have messed my order up every time. The service is either rude or dismissive and the music can sometimes be excessively loud. The food is decent, I\u2019ll give it that. It\u2019s the only place in Collegetown that serves burgers and by default there\u2019s no other options. The prices, however, are very high and have no reason being that much. I\u2019ve stopped going here and will continue to do so unless there are enough changes to make it worth both my time and money.",
            "The food doesn't come fast. But it's reliably good. They have a take out side and a sit down side, both of which worship Cornell. The staff are friendly and it's open late. When it's not mobbed it's a good place to watch a game (they had several different ones). Easy, tasty, a little slower, but well worth it.",
            "The first time we ordered i was not a fan, I had the chicken mac and cheese, it was dry. we decided to give it another chance and this time i did the pulled pork mac and cheese and it was AMAZING. the pork was amazing and the Mac and cheese was nice and creamy.",

            "Tl;dr: waited over 30 minutes for an order of mozzarella sticks that weren't even hot when they came out, cheese still stiff and marinara sauce straight-from-the-fridge cold. Had to cook the sticks myself when I got home because I didn't want to waste the $7 I'd paid for them.\n\nLast night I went in for a quick drink and decided to get some food while at the bar--I proceeded to wait about 30 minutes for an order of mozzarella sticks and a free side of fries, so long that the bartender actually had to go to the window twice to ask why the food was taking so long, and I heard a woman in the back chastising the cook for taking so long with the food--not sure what was going on back there, but I'm not sure how that person still has a job because they seemed to be behind the inefficiency of the whole operation not just last night, but on the many occasions I've waited more than 20-25 minutes for food.\n\nWhen the food finally came out, the fries came first, and the mozzarella sticks took an additional 8 or so minutes. They were lukewarm and the cheese inside was still stiff, and the marinara was cold, as if it had been hastily removed from the fridge so that the food could get to me quickly--when the cook had OVER 30 MINUTES to simply heat mozzarella sticks and some sauce and put them in a box.\n\nThe wait times at Jack's were actually improving--I come here about once a month--but last night was an absolute travesty. I have a final today and actually have significantly less time to study because food that should take about 10, maybe 15 minutes given regular traffic, took over 30. When I left the bar, having to box up my food and leave immediately because I'd already been there for over an hour, the restaurant portion had about 7-9 people inside, about half or one-third capacity. This is far from their busiest night, so I don't understand why there was such a significant delay, for food that I actually had to cook myself when I got back home.\n\nOne woman in Jack's, a lively redhead, is an absolute ray of sunshine who always apologizes if service is slow and knows some of my late-night orders by heart, so it's especially disappointing that waiting times make the whole operation look bad. It seems there is a very clear weakness here that should be addressed so that Jack's doesn't lose business over something so simple. Overall, decent food, but wait times and rather high prices are the reason I do not visit Jack's more than once a month or every 1.5 months despite living 2 minutes away.",
            "Completely delicious. Ordered delivery and it was earlier than expected, the food was hot and the chicken wings are huge! My husband and I can't wait to try everything on the menu! Best delivery in Ithaca so far.",
            ".... The last 2 times I've ordered, I've found blonde hair strands in my grilled chicken salad. Tried to give them the benefit of the doubt the first time :( My order yesterday was also super late and the app notified me that it had been delivered when it absolutely had not been... came 30 mins later. Kinda annoying. Just disappointed.",
            "Won\u2019t come back again after this time because of the unfriendly service and awful food. The chicken wings are extremely salty the first time I tried them. This time they are even more salty, and also bloody, even if I noted well done. The chicken wings I ordered this time are extremely intolerable. And the service is disappointing. The staffs kept chatting for a long time and kept me waiting. She finally noticed me after I said hi for several times, and then kept me waiting for a while.",
            "Cassie was my server and she\u2019s an absolute sweetheart! She was really funny and made sure all of us were taken care of even though it was a really busy night.

They come to my door and one of the Milkshake cups is broken completely up the side. I called and spoke with a manager who said he would send me a new one. Here I am 2 hours later and still no milkshake for him. Never had issues before but I'm never ordering again.",

            "Showed up at 7:15 on a Saturday night. Ordered from the kiosk with 10 people infront of us. Got a burger and fries with milkshake and quesadilla. People had been waiting for over an hour at that point infront of us. Got our food an hour and a half later. Burger was undercooked and cold. Didn\u2019t even waste time to go try to get money back. Restaurant was also extremely messy with no one cleaning the whole time we were there. I would never go back or recommend.",
            "Customer service is awful and food is overpriced\n\nMy most recent experience: Ordered take out chicken strips ready for 15 minutes. Got there 15 minutes later and proceeded to wait over a half hour for my food. Bugged a worker about my order about 20 minutes in, and he said my food was coming. When it finally did come out, it still somehow managed to be cold. And the icing on the cake was they gave me the wrong sauce. Too bad it's one of the few takeout places in collegetown because it sucks.\n\nYou're better off just driving to mcdonalds up by triphammer...",

            "As a representative of the hospitality industry, great customer service is something I take pride in daily. The service I received from Jack's Grill certainly went above my expectations. The gentlemen taking my order was very polite and courteous over the phone. There was a promo code for first time users that did not work online. I then called to ask why it was not working and I was told that code is no longer valid. After explaining that the promo code is still advertise on the website, they went ahead and acknowledge the code anyway.There is no doubt that I just received such great service and not to mention the best wings in Ithaca :). Thank you Jack's Grill for a wonderful experience and I will definitely see you soon.",
            "Thanks Ashley for the thoughtful and courteous response! Glad we made your experience a great one.",
            "So happy that they deliver to Ludlowville. Barely anyone delivers out here without a crazy delivery fee. I placed an order today at 5:55pm, and it was on it's way by 6:15pm, received around 6:30pm. Fastest we've ever had from anywhere. We ordered the hamburger milkshake specials, shrimp po boy, garlic fries, flurry BOGO special, deep fried cookie dough. Jack's called immediately to let me know that the toppings I picked for the flurries were not available, and let me know the many other choices - able to pick 2 others that were just fine. Also, they have a coupon right now for $4 off delivery, and they have free kids meals for kids under 18 - so got chicken fingers and small mac and cheese for free! Po boy had a great sauce and was full of fried shrimp. The garlic fries were so good, but so much oil, and the Jack's sauce for dipping is very good. Pacman burger was also great, but pork belly was fatty and tough - would order burger again and hold the pork belly. Fresh cut fries were a bit undercooked, but I think that was just because they were kicking butt getting our order done and out to us in record time. Milkshakes and flurries were perfect and still frozen when they got to our house. Would definitely order again. So many things to choose from on the menu, great specials, and they deliver to Ludlowville!",
            "Horrible experience. Incredibly overpriced for how underwhelming the food is, and beyond terrible service (worst I\u2019ve ever received in my life.)

Every time I have gotten food it\u2019s been super good and they have always been accommodating. They are big on specials and coupons, free kids food (burger, mac&cheese, or tenders) with a purchase of at least $10. Check out their Jacks Grill App they have a bunch of goodies on there.",
            "A VERY rude lady works there.  Between the glass over the counter, the fan going, a mask on her face, and the ovens running, I couldn't hear that she explained cash first, then you pay with a card.  Which is very strange. I told her I didn't have cash, after she watched me take a card out. She started screaming at me saying that she already explained it.  And I told her that I heard none of it because of all the noise in there.  She then got even more hostile with me and said \"You were literally standing right there when I told you.\" She then proceeded to scream inaudible things at me as I told her that she did not need my business and then I left, while she was still screaming.  Their food is incredibly pricey as well.  I'm not paying for her to take out all her anger on me.  Don't go here.",

Tried calling and explaining that we never received the order and they refused to give money back (or redeliver) and give us their name.

After ordered a combo with fries at full price, I was told in a quite rude manner that I cannot get two portions of fries with my order while they promoted to have \"free fries Friday\". Oh, I probably should also mention they never put extra tomato on my burger even I ordered so. Not a big deal, but I as a customer like to be treated as I am paying.",

            "Failed to deliver, manager basically accused me of not picking up the phone (when no call was made), not being there (havent left for 6 hours), etc etc when I was waiting and called as soon as the estimated waiting period passed (around 50 minutes after original order). He tried to guilt me to pay for the food I never received as I would ruin the driver if I reported the food stolen or missing. Basically tried to get me to sink $20 to not get someone in trouble. Got my $20 back by calling grubhub, never paying in advance again.",

            "I literally eat here everyday - sometimes multiple times a day. After thoroughly exploring Collegetown I came to the conclusion that Jack's has some of the highest quality food available in the area.  I highly recommend their variety of Macaroni and their pulled pork fries are to die for.  They have a NY cheddar cheese sauce that is outstanding.  I really enjoy their variety of grilled cheese sandwiches as well.\n\nThe ONLY criticism I can make is that *sometimes* the service could be better.. They have some staff members that are very accommodating  and give 5/5 service.  Some, however are a little lesa friendly - which is ok - but some may say the service could be better.\n\nAllin all, I love Jack's grill.",
            "Best burger in this side of the lake. The restaraunt isn't very big, so it can get busy, but worth the wait if you have to. This isn't a McDonald's burger place so don't expect McDonald's prices. Family of 4 will cost $70 or more, but the taste is outstanding.",
            "Love their adult grilled cheese sandwiches. Minus a star because it\u2019s very expensive for what you get. An adult grilled cheese does not include fries on the side. Instead you must pay over $3 for fries on the side. I also don\u2019t like how a simple cup off bbq sauce is extra as well. Over $16 for a grilled cheese and fries no drink. Good food but not something I can get often because of the price.",
            "So can you believe they took 40 minutes and still did not get my burger out. When I complained they were so rude and the manager did not even come out to listen to the complain. Trust me you don't want to be served that way for an average burger. I really wish that this shop closes and we get an actual burger place. People from my school have stopped going here and advised me against it, but I still went thinking that they can't be that bad...but it turned out to be horrible!",

I arrive 30 minutes later & am stuck waiting another full 30 minutes in store. Additionally, the neither popcorn chicken had any sauce, so they were just plain fried chicken bites. The cajun fries weren\u2019t even cajun! Just normal fries!

A college town fast food place that doesn't even have real seating shouldn't take a hour to make a ok at best sandwich. Will never go back again. Service was horrible as well",

Eventually I said \"excuse me,\" and loathingly someone came out and asked \"what!?\"  I explained I wanted onion rings and they told me to go to the ipad.  Eventually I told them it wasn't doing what I wanted and a guy manually filled it out for me, but told me he would have to charge me a seperate price for the onion rings instead of subsituting them (even if it costed a little extra) for the onion rings.

An hour, had gone past so we called in regards to an eta of arrival in which we were told the driver left awhile ago and Mike (whom which we spoke to) was shocked she was not already there but she should be there any minute. Another 20 mins go by and we call again. In which we are met with Mike\u2019s rude behavior despite us concerned about whether our food would arrive. Mike then rudely proceed to hang up the call on us. This service and attitude was deplorable and repulsive. The service received was unjustified and to be honest avoidable if our order had been completed the first time rather than half.",

There was one dude working, didn't catch his name, he was awesome; courteous, hard working, and apologetic for him being the only.  I completely understood, it happens.  I could tell he was in a good mood and I didn't want break is groove by being impatient.  It appeared he enjoys working there, which is odd for folks working in food service.  Please give that dude a cash money bonus of some sort. I was not disappointed in the food that I was given.  While eating, my wife said, \"Wow! These are really good wings.\" For myself I really liked the loaded nachos(waffle fries) and the 2 loaded tender sandwiches. They were the same price as the \"nachos\" but felt I got more bang for my buck with the \"nachos\".  I'll be increasing the spicyness next time, tested the waters with the one and 2 pepper sauces.  Thank you very much, we'll be back.",
            "Hi Joseph,\n\nThank you for sharing your 5-star experience with us!\n\nWe are happy to hear you enjoyed our new Cheesy Chicken Bacon Menu items and that your wife enjoyed our wings! We are also glad you received great service, we will let the store team know.\n\nWe look forward to serving you again soon!\n\nBest,\nCarolyn",
            "It's an overrated place.\n\nThe food is okay, but probably not acceptable given it's not cheap.\nThe lady working behind the register was unnecessarily rude and impatient with us.\nI really wouldn't recommend it, but given that there aren't that many options in Ithaca, I'd probably come here again once in a blue moon.",
            "Hi Yama,\nWe take pride in having the highest quality chicken for the best price. Regardless, it sounds like our service wasn't up to our high standards. We would love for you to give us another try. Could you email us the details of your order and experience at hello@wingsover.com so we can learn more about your visit and make this right?\nBest,\nWings",
            "Came here hoping to get some wings for dinner. Little did I know the wait would be over an hour for a \u201cfast food\u201d restaurant. I sat there for about an hour after receiving no estimation of time because I assumed it would be quick. After an hour of waiting I asked for a refund and I was told 10 more minutes on my order. After about 20 more minutes I finally got my refund and was told that they hadn\u2019t even started it. Don\u2019t come to this establishment. It is a waste of your time and not worth it at all. You could go to a real restaurant and half a 5 course meal in the same amount of time that I didn\u2019t even receive my meal.",

            "10/10 experience! First time visiting wings over Ithaca and Mel was so sweet! Fast service and great employees. She was very enthusiastic and helpful (brought out some samples of sauces I was thinking about trying). Can\u2019t wait to come back!",
            "Hi Samantha,\n\nThanks for sharing your 5-star experience with us!\n\nWe will pass this note along to Mel - she is the best!

            "The food was great and all, but the service was next level! Our server was Maddi (I hope I got the spelling right) and she was bomb! She made great recommendations, was extremely polite, always answered my questions with a smile, and worked with the kind of pride you'd expect from the business owners themselves. The food was 5 star but I'd give the service 6!",

            "Relatively fast service compared to a lot of the other restaurants especially during busy nights. Ordered 4 times online so far, and each time took about 30 minutes according to the website. I would always get there 30 minutes later to pick up, and they would have my food ready for pickup every time. Has not failed me so far, highly recommend, keep up the good work.",

            "The online ordering process is not friendly.\nThe friendly customer service is something that you can count on. The food is stupendous. Size of the wings is average. It is cooked very well with a little crisp outside with a tender inside.\nThe sauces and dry rubs are original and tasty. Hot means hot and sweet is just right.\nOverall experiences have been great.\nLove this spot.",
            "Really good food, fresh non-frozen wings.",
            "Thanks Peter! Fresh - never frozen :)\n\nPlease come back again soon!",
            "I wish I could give it a zero. Order at 7:42 told on website pick up would be a little after 8. Got there and they said we were next and we ended up leaving at 8:40 with no food . We were eating late and wouldn't have ordered it (4 tenders fries and 6 wings) if we had known we would be waiting and hour or more. Kids left hungry and now most places were closing. Very disappointed in not only service but how the front counter handled the experience. I'm very unlikely to recommend to anyone bc of the long wait times.",
            "Hi Ariana,\n\nI apologize for this experience with us.\n\nWe cook our food to order and do everything we can to get it to our guests as fast and as fresh as possible but we definitely missed the mark this time.

            "We order online and pickup. Many times it isn't ready 20-30 minutes after the designated pickup time. This time, we ordered at 6:40, the website told us to pickup at 7:00. Based on our experience, we come to pickup at 7:20 so we don't have to wait. We get there, and are told it'll be another 10-15 minutes. Go wait in the car and come back at 7:30 and they are just boxing it for us. The cashier said it's actually an hour wait from when you order and not when the website says. So I said \"well the website said it'd be ready at 7:00, I don't remember what time I ordered but do you know when it'd be ready based off that?\" the manager, I presume, behind her said \"yeah the wait times aren't accurate when we're busy, but hey you're food is coming out right now.\" like I don't care that it takes an hour, but update your wait times on your website. I'd rather spend the hour in my house than in your restaurant or in my car. \ud83d\ude10",

            "Great service from the staff. Delicious sauces and great portions for the dipping sauces. On the menu the hangar meal doesn't specify if you get actual wings or tenders. I was hoping I would get wings but I got tenders. I'm not sure how you specify when you are ordering online. Was delicious nonetheless. Chicken without the sauce is a bit bland though. Cheesy tots were stellar, but the bacon could have been crispy instead of soggy. I love the fact that their to-go hanger meals are in aluminum pans. Perfect so I can reheat leftovers in the oven with ease! Only reason I'm giving 4 not three stars is because they have freaking Coca-Cola products! Coke is so scarce around these parts especially on Cornell campus, all the northerners seem to prefer Pepsi (Battery Acid).\n\nI'd definitely say its the best restaurant I've had here in Ithaca so far in terms of guest service, flavor, price, and campus convenience.",
            "Our most recent visit to Wings exceeded my expectations. We had friendly service and good food. The toughest part of the visit is trying to decide the quantity of chicken you want to eat and the flavors. We love the boneless tenders and we typically purchase one of their meal deals for the family. The other bonus is the soda machine that allows you to customize your drink flavors. We will be back and return often.",
            "I love the honey BBQ chicken fingers, boneless.  They are juicy and tender.\nI can get bone in wings any place. These are the best tenders I have ever tried!",
            "Hi Marilyn,\n\nThanks for sharing this review with us!\n\nWe are glad to hear you enjoy our fresh, never frozen tenders and our Honey BBQ, it's definitely one of our favorite flavors.\n\nWe look forward to serving you again soon!\nCarolyn",
            "I LOVE Wings over! Every time I come back to Ithaca I have to stop in. This time I made a huge order for my crew, and Melanie and Maddie totally nailed it. Some of the best service I\u2019ve ever received. Can\u2019t wait for the next time I get to Wings Over Ithaca",
            "Hi there,\n\nThanks for sharing this amazing review with us!\n\nWe pride ourselves on having great people and are glad Melanie and Maddie were just that! We will pass this along to them!\n\nThanks again and we can't wait to serve you again soon!\nCarolyn",
            "I ordered the 4 tenders and got the Cajun BBQ and it was rlly good. Also the staff was very friendly. However, I giving this place 3 stars because the Buffalo chicken sandwich I ordered was a bit dry and it was a bit overdone. I would still recommend it, just not any of the sandwiches.",
            "Hi Henry,\n\nThanks for sharing your experience with us!\n\nWe are glad to hear you love our Cajun BBQ tenders! Thank you for your feedback about the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.

            "Food is honestly great. The wings are great. Chicken sandwich wasn't that good tbh but my reason for it being 4 star is the prices. Very great food but I feel like the prices are a little high. Overall a great experience. The garlic tossed wings and cheese fries are hella good!",

            "Great wings, often a little cheaper (and much larger) than BWW.  Excellent choice of flavors, good waffle fries. The honey mustard is what got me hooked, but the Buffalo sauces are excellent as well.  Basic atmosphere and small interior but clean, with friendly staff.  Orders typically ready in 20 minutes.  Across the street from the municipal parking garage; parking can be challenging at busy times of day.",
            "Best Chicken Tenders I\u2019ve ever had in my entire life. I absolutely love the Kick of the Hot & Fire sauce\u2019s \ud83e\udd24. Friendly Staff and extremely Fast Service for being in the middle of Collegetown. I\u2019m a customer forever. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f",

            "I ordered online around 8:24pm and it was an estimated hour wait on a tuesday?!?\nLuckily it didn't take that long.  Next they called me to say they were out of Dr. Pepper so could they substitute Coke instead.  When the food came the driver said they forgot to tell me they had to substitute Dasani because they were out of Vitamin Water.  I said that was fine and we started to devour our wings then I noticed they forgot the waffle fries.  They were very nice over the phone and said they'd send some out and they sent a brownie out for the inconvenience.  Good customer service.  I will order from them again and the wings were fabulous!",

            "Two of us split an order of 25 wings (~$22).  They tasted good and were saucy.  The only problem was that we were still hungry after finishing them all.  I think I'm not a big fan of wings just because there's so little meat on them...",

            "First timer! Wings were hot, fresh and tasty! Garlic Parm excellent! Honey Bbq has a unique smokey flavor - not the run of the mill bbq sauce mixed with honey taste.  Really pleased - would highly recommend! I will be back WITH friends! Keep up the good work! And hats off to those of you working through the pandemic! You are demonstrating American Grit!",

He cursed me out and refused to speak with me and the female employee working there was kind enough to where I wanted to stay. If I had not paid for my food in advance I would have left that instant.

            "Absolutely horrible delivery service.\nI got my food and it was missing my drink.\nSo I called them and they said they will resend it.\nAn hour later still no drink and they said it is still on the way. After 1hr 30mins I called them again and they said they just left it outside in front of my house. My place is 5min walking distance from the restaurant. I asked them why they didn't even bother to call and they lied saying that they did. When the guy delivered my food the first time he called me from down the block and said he was at my house. Then he made me go get the food because he didn't know which house it was. I will never order from here again.",

            "Always a favorite! They have a variety of seasonings that you can choose from. All are good. Each 1/2 pound of boneless wings can be a different seasoning. The kids all love the garlic parmesan or the teriyaki. Adults too, but the spicy options are our go to. The staff is friendly and helpful. Especially if you aren't sure exactly how much to order. The meal options include great fries and onion rings. Everything really is delicious. This is a frequent college stop. Parking is pretty crazy; however, there is a parking garage right across from the restaurant that is a dollar an hour. Completely worth it, a bit tight on space though. Drive the small car.",

            "Great food, the staff is nice and it's an all around great place.  I am personally of the citrus chipotle sauce, although their buffalo sauces are good and so is the mango habanero (it is sweet and not hot here).  My only qualm is a shortage of seating on occasion.",
            "Worst experience ever... I ordered to dine in but they gave it to me in a to box... Second if thats there version of jerk chicken then its horrible... 3rd. The damn chicken was cold..  4th it took 45 mins for some waffle fries and boneless wings .Then the lady that served me caught a attitude when we asked for the extra blue cheese they didn't give us that we paid for!!!\nAnd I don't mean to be rude but it was clear they knew we were getting up set and not once did anyone even apologize for the inconvenience..",

            "Friendly Service and Great Sauce.  My toddler and I visited one weekday afternoon.  The cashier and staff were very friendly and repeatedly asked if food was ok or if there was anything else they could do for us. We loved the golden sauce and the garlic-parmesan, cajun waffle fries. The buffalo sauce, on the sandwich, was very tastey as well. The chicken seemed as if it were a little dry from over cooking, but overall visit was wonderful and I would reccomend this place to others.",

            "Food arrived an hour later, chicken sandwich was under cooked, and my chicken tenders smelled like medicine. I do not recommend you eat from here it was my 1st and last time ever eating from here",
            "I  visited today and took out a F-16. Then opened the box and found only 12 wings. I called immediately and the guy explained to me that now they sell the wings by weight. What a BS! It should have 15 wings. I have been a customer for 5 years and knew that f16 has 15 wings.\n\nSo the so-called new policy is just to give you less wings. Then why don't you sell it as F12? Or raise the price! Things are more expensive I know this so one bucks or two would be accepted eventually. But this is dishonest. BS. Will not go back and will warn my friends.\n\nAnd yes I double checked their website. Still say 15 wings. BS.\n\nUpdate: 8/2 after my review their whole website changed and now F16 is 17.98 now. Yes 3 bucks more. And there is no description of wings number of F16. So be prepared for 17.98 for 12 wings.\n\nReally really bad.",
            "So food was ok, but our order was missing an order of fries and we had everything delivered to a hotel and we didn\u2019t get any paper plates or napkins.  We order 40ish wings and not a single plate or napkin. Come on guys. Not to mention we didn\u2019t even get everything we paid for so yea probably wouldn\u2019t recommend",

            "If you have a hankering for Japanese bento (lunch box) food, Plum Tree is \"barely OK\". It's conveniently located just steps from Cornell University's campus. Service was fast & attentive. However, the bento box lunch was blander than at any other Japanese restaurant I have visited. For lunch, I had the Chicken Tonkatsu (chicken strips fried in panko crumb batter) w/plum sauce - delicious. But the accompaniments (cold under-salted edamame; meh California roll; boring house salad & dumplings) were all so flavorless. At $14.95, the price was a bit too high. // Interior decor also needs help: The burgundy booth seats, crimson painted walls & salmon-colored floor tiles sorely assault the eyes & do not match. Tone it down. So, one star for atmosphere.",
            "We went to Plum Tree Restaurant today for the first time. The food was so delicious. The service was great as well. I highly recommend it. I will definitely come here more often as there are so many dishes to enjoy!",
            "The service was very friendly.  The location needs a makeover.  The food was a bit overpriced for the quality.  Food was just okay but not bad.  I think this place might be better when the students are back and it\u2019s busier.  If you\u2019re really craving Japanese food and in the area then stop over for a quick bite!  Might be better for their lunch special!",
            "Food was just okay, but overpriced for the quality of food. The raw fish over the sushi was very thin and not fresh, and rice was too dry and firm. We ordered a beef sukiyaki which was not authentic and much more like a beef udon. We 3 people, spent $165, very disappointed.",
            "Absolutely delicious Japanese food. I had Yaki-Udon with chicken, which I loveedd and definitely recommend! I've heard that sake bombs here are worth the try too! I also ordered a miso soup, I personally am not a fan of those, but this was palatable. Sashimi platter was fresh it had 5 types of meat and I thought the quantity was decent. Definitely recommend the salmon here though.",
            "The beef yakisoba I ordered was so tasty! The portion is big too. If I crave Japanese food, this is the restaurant I will choose in Ithaca.",
            "Lunch boxes are nice. Food quality is reasonable. Service is OK.",
            "Very average.\n\nFood is definitely overpriced and the quality is not there. I remember getting two sushi rolls and being hungry at the end of it because they were just so small. Only reason why this place still exists is because of sake bombing. It helps that they never ID too, so I actually recommend it for sake bombing (although four seasons is probably better).",
            "The sushi and other entrees served here were great and inexpensive. The server was always attentive and kind.",
            "I love this place I eat here a lot for lunch and it\u2019s always consistent and available. The food is delicious and the sake as well!",
            "Lived right next door for three years. Good selection, nice staff. Good sushi. Overall 4 stars because in my opinion, the tempura is a little lacking. But if you\u2019re going for sushi, it\u2019s reasonably priced and decent quality (especially being so far from the sea).",
            "The sushi is pretty good, the specialty rolls are very creative.  There are many different choices and they range in price from $10/roll to close to $22/roll.  If you are dining in, they are very accommodating of big parties and sake bombing.  This is a great place to celebrate birthdays or other occasions.",
            "\"This \"sushi\" is disgusting. When did spicy salmon/tuna rolls become this weird mashed up paste?? Take the 10 seconds to slice some fresh fish and toss it with siracha. Its not hard or too costly - you're sacrificing any sense of quality for cheapness/laziness. Also since when is it ok for any restaurant to sell sushi rice that's rubbery? This is sad and unacceptable.",
            "Got lunch with a friend and they were very attentive. If you don\u2019t know what to get, the lunch special w 2 rolls and miso soup is totally worth it and the takoyaki is also super tasty! Will definitely go again.",
            "Had a terrible waiter, very inpatient and did not care about the customer. I don\u2019t understand how can he even directly asked me to give him tips. The sushi is just fine, but not worth the price. This is a never-visit-twice place, perhaps you do not want to visit ever. It is sad that we have this kind of bad restaurant at Ithaca.",
            "The tempura I ordered came in as a big set, very filling, but the tempura sauce tasted almost just like ordinary soy sauce, which made the meal a little bit dull. The avocado sushi roll was pretty good.",
            "It is a very good lunch choice in this area. I will come to have dinner next time. I want to try more food.\nI think the price is fair, most food was raised their price.",
            "This is one of my favorite places to go get some really good sushi. They have a wide array of sushi. They even have sushi for those that can't eat rice, Its a very good roll. I have gone several times with my young children and have still received good service. I would def look to bring friends here that are looking for japanese food.",
            "Kind of sketchy location but the food is pretty good and the portion size is decent for the price. Kind of oily but filling. Good if you want japanese food and don't have anything else",
            "Atmosphere and drinking scene is great. Food is often overlooked but it really is quite good for Japanese in Ithaca.",
            "Not sure I should really export more from a small town sushi place, but the quality of the fish was just mediocre. Their special rolls have too much sauce for my taste and the cuts of sashimi just seem off. Also tried a bento box with chicken katsu which was a little dry but tasty and a good value. For some reason, they use the actual sushi bar to stack dishes and pitchers; doesn't seem like they usually sit people there?!",
            "4.5/5 My favorite Japanese restaurant in Ithaca. Very comfortable atmosphere, good sushi, many other menu options (Udon, katsu, etc.), plenty of sake choices. I've been there a few times with my family and never been disappointed.",
            "The sushi was fresh and the service was great! You get a really good portion of the fried rice with the price. Its popular for a reason! Food here is really good and I definitely recommend it!",
            "Fast delivery. Have a great sushi lunch special!",
            "They took 10' to take our orders, +45' to bring the food, and even one of the waitress got confused and brought the check to our empty and clean table.\n\nIt is impossible to provide a service for 100+ clients with 5 waiters unevenly distributed.\n\nCome by only if you want to waste your time...",
            "Good food at reasonable prices. Some of the dishes may be a bit pricey, but you get a corresponding amount of food. Of course it is already possible to run up a bill with sushi.",
            "If you can drive go to the buffet down town. Far away, same quality food just cheaper. Yeah I guess it\u2019s a nice fa\u00e7ade for a date but for real not that special.",
            "Nice place, great staff! It's a bit pricey unless you get the lunch specials, which I love!! Definitely try it out.",
            "Delivery was fast and food quality was fine. The gyoza were a bit oily and the spicy tuna roll was a bit weird in that it had breadcrumbs in the spicy tuna.",
            "Dishes are pretty delicious, and the staff there is quite nice! But the light inside is a little bit dim. And the price is not cheap.",
            "I remember when I came to this restaurant for dinner at school, I saw dirty floating objects on the soup, which was disgusting, and there was some sand in other meals. I think it was not washed clean and the hygiene was very poor!  !",
            "The noodles and appetizers were good, the sushi was not, but they did have a really big selection.",
            "Great spot for lunch. Large selection of rolls. Fast service. Interior/design of the place is a little uninspiring but food is great!",
            "Good service. Prices are acceptable. I ate Ramen and sushi and I was satisfied.",
            "The food is just ok but the lady who works there is very rude. She came to our table and very brusquely said \"We're closed, you need to leave. We want to go home now.\" So rude.",
            "We have been ordering takeout regularly here since the pandemic, and the sushi is wonderful!!",
            "Extremely friendly service, whether you're there for sake-bombing or a great sushi dinner. Strongly recommend the Mermaid and Dragon rolls!",
            "Is it authentic Japanese? I don't really know. The bento boxes are so good though that it doesn't matter to me. The donburi is very good too.",
            "Getting worse and worse(not fresh, rediculous service, I didn\u2019t get my hot tea due to the reason of \u201cwe are out of cups\u201d WTF???) I\u2019d rather walk more 60ft to eat the subway.",

We asked for more water, and she didn\u2019t bring any. Asked for a knife, she forgot too. The food generally came out slow. One of the dishes didn\u2019t come out for a very long time because she put the order in incorrectly, which I understand if it was her first day on the job. Despite saying that she would compensate us for it, she still charged us for it as well as sides that were supposed to come with the meal. She didn\u2019t even know what sides came with the meal and over charged us by $25 before tax and tip.\n\nWe asked for a refund of those items, but the restaurant didn\u2019t refund us the tax and tip on the $25. They only refunded us $27 when it was supposed to be $31.5 ($25 x (1.08 for tax +0.18 for tip) = $31.5) The restaurant still owed us 4.5 bucks. When we asked about the difference, the server had an attitude and said there was nothing she could do with the system. It\u2019s your system. We just want our money back!\n\nThe restaurant charged a 18% gratuity for parties 7 or more, but I think they deserved 0%. Never again!",

He interrupted me as I was asking about menu items and was very dismissive. Part of our party couldn\u2019t make our reservation and we heard him loudly complaining about our table, our reservation change, and us to customers at the table next to us. The only reason he could ever be able to get away with this behavior is because of the forced gratuity on the checks. To reiterate I have never received service this poor in my life it was almost unreal. Overall food wasn\u2019t bad but not worth the degradation.",

Thanks \u201cjon jon\u201d as my two year old calls him. Our family had a great time!!",
            "This place was really disappointing. We had to wait over an hour for our food, and when it finally came, it was all room temperature and seemed like it had been sitting out for a while. I ordered the avocado toast and it was the smallest portion I'd ever received from a restaurant. The food tasted fine but did not have the freshness you'd expect. They also messed up my friend's order, which asked for no cheese. Our waitress was nice, this is definitely a management issue rather than an individual staff issue as other tables had similar problems. I won't be returning here, there are way better brunch places in Ithaca.",

            "Food was great, our whole party liked their food. That being said, this was the worst service experience of my life. We originally had a reservation for nine people but only five of us were able to show up which I understand is not ideal but our waiter (Craig) was LOUDLY bad mouthing us to the table right next to us while that table was peacefully eating. It made the environment awkward and uncomfortable and all of us felt so disrespected. If we asked questions about the menu he would immediately shut us down. I am typically really understanding when it comes to the service industry but my friends and I were being legitimately disrespected and belittled. He was being nice to every other table except for ours even though we were nothing but pleasant customers. Come for the food and if your waiter is Craig, ask for another one.",

            "worst service i have ever received in my life and this is coming from someone with extremely low standards\u2026our server had no idea what was going on and it seemed like she had never stepped foot into a restaurant before. not necessarily blaming her\u2014the management just seems awful with how slow everything was and how little training the new servers had.\n\nfirst, we ordered a beer and she brought us a water glass instead of a pint glass (understandable mistake for someone new). then, we ordered a bottle of prosecco, and she brought us wine glasses instead of flutes. she then proceeded to bring us the entirely wrong bottle. then comes the good part: she comes back with the correct bottle, and says to us verbatim: \u201ci\u2019m not going to lie, i don\u2019t know how to open this\u201d and proceeds to drop the UNOPENED bottle at our table and walk away. luckily, my friends and i knew how to open it ourselves, but that could\u2019ve ended in a really bad situation.\n\nfinally, the manager of the place walks by our table, and we bring up our multiple concerns that we experienced throughout the night. he is very apologetic and claims that they were new and still getting the place \"up and running\" (which i guess entails not training their employees). he then tries to walk away without offering us any sort of compensation until i asked, and he ended up giving us a round of free shots. i'd normally never complain at a restaurant, but this was really the first time i felt like something had to be said. it's a shame too because the vibe was absolutely great, and this could've been our new go-to spot, but this unfortunate experience will probably deter me from returning in the future.",

My wife had the spicy seafood noodle plate, and there was only one large shrimp and one mussel, plus a few calamari rings. This in a large plate of noodles. Hardly a seafood plate.\nWe will not return to this restaurant.",

The other dish we ordered was very good tasting as well. However, as soon as we left the restaurant, we got sick. Not what we expected due to the other reviews.",

We asked again and they asked for 20 more minutes. Two hours after our order time, our food still wasn\u2019t ready for pickup. Absolutely ridiculous, never coming back here for takeout again",
            "I had high hopes for this place because of its four stars rating.  I was craving for Korean style Chinese food.  The staff appeared to be Chinese, not Korean.  They also have extreme limited English, which made it difficult to order.  I ordered three basic dishes for a Korean style Chinese restaurant: fried dumplings, chajangmyun and champon.\n\nThe dumplings were obviously not home made.  They were frozen packaged dumplings.  To make matters worse, they burnt the dumplings, making the skin dark and crunchy and dry.\n\nChajangmyun was also not home made.  It was also from a package.  I know it well because I have had that package chajangmyun before.  Fine for $5 package food.  Not fine as an $8 dish at a restaurant.\n\nChampon was unremarkable and bland spicy soup with noodle from the same package chajangmyun that I had just tried.  And they added broccoli into the soup.  What champon place does that?  Not authentic at all.  For nearly $13, I expect much better.\n\nThe service was fair but the cook kept loudly shouting Korean-Chinese mixed swear words at the waiter throughout the dinner, ruining further an already unpleasant dining experience.  Between multiple \"mother----cker\" and other choice Korean swear words, I just felt sorry for the waiter.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague.",

This may be the restaurant whose food I crave most, and I find some of the lower reviews totally incomprehensible.\n\nWhy four stars instead of five, then? While the service is otherwise great, I've found some staff dismissive and inconsiderate when it comes to a medical dietary restriction. That's a \"minus\" not everyone will experience, but something to know for those with food allergies.",

We actually ate at Koko the other choice in town and it was pleasant, delicious, and wonderful",

Had the pork bone soup, which was very good but underseasoned and too expensive for the cheapest cut of pork meat.\n\nI'm completely grateful for the staffing at the restaurant, but it kind of takes away from the Korean experience when you hear waiters speaking Spanish at the front counter.\n\nGood venue, clean restaurant, but overpriced. For the price I would expect more, authentic Korean side dishes, more kimchi, and slightly larger portions.",
            "This was an incredible dining experience. We ordered six entrees between three people that I\u2019ve never tried before, and I was extremely impressed! Can\u2019t wait to go back",
            "Back to town after so many years. I was excited to see Four Seasons still there. Unfortunately, the quality of their food wasn't the same. It wasn't really Korean anymore. If you are looking for actual Korean food, you need to go some place else. Staff were nice and friendly.",
            "Research Korean BBQ and how to cook at one before going.  Food was good but felt a little unwelcome.",
            "We came here for kbbq (as first-timers) and ordered bulgogi & samgyeopsal-gui, as well as miso soup & dumpling soup. Everything came out quickly and was very tasty! We received 6 sides with the barbecue as well as bowls of rice. The sides were so yummy and we received refills of kimchi for free! Overall, a great experience. Everything came to about $40 as well! The only \"bad\" moment was an awkward interaction with an older lady (possibly the owner?) who slightly rude and very confused about the fact we didn't have anything on the grill at the moment. We were just eating and hadn't put on new meat. It was our first time doing korean barbecue so maybe we were just missing something lol",
            "Well the worst korean I have ever had. I ordered fried mandu and boy they were fried all right. Dripping in grease and barely any filling. They definitely are not traditional mandu. More like gyoza or wonton. The spicy squid and pork sweet with hardly any spice. Definitely won't be back.",
            "This was our first time eating in this restaurant, my son had recommended the place but said the service was poor as the lady who is the hostess is rude.  We decided to go anyway and see for ourselves.  Wish we hadn\u2019t.  We ordered  just a couple or items and the hostess said \u201cis that all you are gonna order?\u201d  That\u2019s not enough food and walked away upset.  My husband wanted to leave as he was not happy with her rudeness and how she responded to us as customers.  She then handed the table over to another waiter to take care of us.  When the food came out, they didn\u2019t provide any plates, we had to go and ask for some plates nor did  they check on us if we needed anything.  We had to then go ask for our check and when my husband went to pay and signed the credit card receipt, the waiter said that he had forgot to put the tip on.  My husband said he was going to put cash on the table.  We left a $5 tip, way too much for how we we were treated.  A tip is a generous way of saying thank you for serving us and taking care of our needs..  I generally tip between 20-25% because how hard these servers work, especially how low they are paid.  With COVID, a lot of restaurants are struggling so we try and support small businesses during this very vulnerable time in our country.  Tips are earned by the service with a smile.  This place is horrible for service, food was okay, I would have rather went to subway next door, at least there I wouldn\u2019t have been questioned on the amount of food I was ordering or not.  I WOULD NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!",
            "Overall I think the restaurant was a really fun atmosphere. I personally am not an egg fan (which is common in Korean dishes), but their dishes without egg are pretty appetizing. I personally wish they included more sake with the sake bomb and a larger beer size similar to their competitors, but I'm pretty sure their sake bombing is on the cheaper end.",
            "Food: Really good kimchi jiggae, bold authentic flavors instead of the watered down soups up the street. Unfortunately, though there was a fair amount of pork, the portion was rather small. On the other hand wife liked her box and came away full.\n\nService: Wait staff was pretty inattentive both times I went. Food comes out incredibly fast, but then the waiter will ghost you until they drop off your check.\n\nValue: A mix. I suggest coming during a weekday lunch, rather than dinner or on the weekend, as the portions are the same but dinner/weekend is around 20% more expensive.",
            "The food taste mediocre (or below) in all the Korean Restaurants I went. Beyond that, the service is way more rude/rough than the taste of the food. The co-owner of the restaurant, an Asian guy named Isareal (I may spell it wrong) Who asked us to leave when we want to order our food in a timely manner (waited 10+minutes already) as he was arranging the table for a bigger party.\n\nThe conversation was like:\n\nMe: \u201cCan we order now?\u201d\nHim: \u201cGive us a few minutes, we have a big party is coming.\u201d\nMe: \u201cI don\u2019t have a few minutes because\u2026\u201d\nHe cut off and then say:\n\u201cIf you could not wait, just leave\u201d\n\nBoth me, my friends and the couple sat beside our table get shocked because of his arrogant attitude, their customer services, and the rude behaviours. We left and we will NEVER COME BACK and NEVER RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANY OF OUR FRIENDS.\n\nBefore we sat at our table, a group of 4 asked to split their bills and he basically answered: \u201cNo, I am so busy and do not have time to split your bill, you\u2019d have to give me one card\u201d\n\nSo RUDE AND ARROGANT.",
            "I lived in Korea for two years and am ALWAYS excited to eat Korean food again when I can.  In my hometown there isn't any Korean food or Indian or Thai but I digress.\n\nI was not impressed with this place.  I've eaten there twice.  It was edible but by no means great.  Very small and very few side dishes and expensive .  Strangely I cannot remember small [pieces broccoli for a side dish in Korea?\n\nIn almost every restaurant in Korea you would get at least 10 overflowing side dishes that would be refilled as you ate them.\n\nDidn't like the atmosphere inside....very small and just thrown together like a robot would put together a restaurant.  No feeling no pizzaz.   no feeling.   and the food was mediocre.",
            "OMG, they have one very arrogant waiter (possibly the owner) and he said something in a Very COLD face like \u201cwe have so many customers every day, if you don\u2019t like, just don\u2019t come\u201d. We were SOOOO SHOCKED. This conversation happened after we were left unattended for 30 MINUTES before we order and 30 MINUTES after the dinner and asked him why we still need to pay 18% tip for a group of five.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to see him AGAIN",
            "First, we loved our waiter Israel. Such great service and he really went out of his way to be friendly and helpful.\n\nWe had the LA galbi, Dolsot bibimbap, and gochu pajeon - all very good for Americanized Korean. After living in SK for 2+ years this definitely satisfies the Korean cravings (and the ambiance fits the hole-in-the-wall Kbbq spots, where else do you get Hangul wallpaper?).",
            "I can\u2019t believe there was a plastic bag in our huge bone soup last time. It was 2 years ago but I\u2019m still horrified by this fact and their response. They simply didn\u2019t cancel the order and offered to cook another one for us after we were already full. NEVER GO THERE PLS their food safety practice is concerning.",
            "Our food came out surprisingly fast and was really good! It's a cute restaurant. I got the pork katsu and my company got the bulgogi box. The side dishes were good as well. Really, just a very good experience.",
            "I eat here two or three times a week.\nEverything is great - but the stews, casseroles, and Bulgogee are the best in the states.\nMy favourite lunch/comfort food is the squid bowl, it comes out sizzling in a stone bowl. Spicy.\nThe owners are really nice people, when they see me and my buddy they put our order in ( they know I'm in a hurry most days ).\nI've seen a few reviews complain about price, so get the box lunch and be full for about $10. You can't get a happy meal for that. I'm sure if you explain you're on a budget they'll throw a little extra rice in your bowl.\nI should also mention, the wait staff wait for you to call them over, as is the custom anywhere outside the U.S.\nGreat dinner date place too. A little habatchi at your table and some soju makes for nice ambience.",
            "I\u2019ve worked here as a waiter for a long time, and also at other restaurants as well while paying college tuition - It\u2019s a good place to eat - chef is the owner, so you know he cares, and it\u2019s hygienic and up to standards. I highly recommend anyone here looking to eat Korean cuisine",
            "I love eating at this place. But one time I went to eat with my siblings. We ordered the BBQ. There was four of us so we ordered two BBQ. They gave us one small basket of lettuce which only have 4 to 5 small piece to wrap the meat. We asked for more because that wasn't enough to wrap the meat with. They gave us a few more piece which is still  just 4 piece or lettuce. When I got the bill, they charge me $11 extra for the lettuce when I can just buy the whole lettuce for only around 3 to $4.  Plus the lady who was serving us never smiles. As always she looked pissed.",
            "pretty solid korean bbq. for a collegetown eatery, the place is great, servers are kind and attentive. it can get a little busy later in the night because a lot of clubs like to throw events here but in general, it's a solid bet.",
            "Had two orders of the korean bbq. Entire ordered totalled more than $30. The service was terrible. The waitress kept interrupting, placing our food on the grill without us requesting help. Every other korean restaurant I've been in has kept the side dishes filled, but this one did not, despite of having ordered two bbq dishes. I didn't get my $30 worth of food.",
            "Excellent yukgejang.  Solid Korean bbq selections for very reasonable prices.  The cold noodles are fine too.  But unless you like udon noodles, don't bother with any of the hot noodle dishes.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  The restroom is clean, at least when it's not packed.  Best korean restaurant in Ithaca by far.",
            "Pork bulgogi and squid bibimbap are good. Green grape flavoured soju goes well with these dishes on Fri/Sat nights :) However, this place is on the expensive side.",
            "I lived in Korea for several years, and this is probably the most authentic Korean food in the area.  It's not the cheapest, but tastes great and the portions leave you very full.  I usually get bi bim bap or bulgogi, which are consistently good; haven't experimented beyond those two.",
            "Decent Korean food. Typically play it safe and get the dolsot bi bim bap. They have good tteokbokki and it can be fun to do the Korean bbq (a bit expensive though).",
            "In a land of the blinds, one-eyed man is king!Ordered delivery from here for dinner tonight (2 beef bibimbab and vegetable pajun). None of the vegetables and beef were seasoned. The food showed up cold and without the accompanying miso soup. The banchan was kimchi and some fish cakes, pretty sad. Not sure a place like this would survive with real competition. I heard they were busy tonight but that's no excuse!",
            "This place was great for our event. We came for dinner as a group of 8, with a reservation, and the menu is great. The ambiance is nothing amazing, but the food came out quickly and it was all delicious.",
            "Fast, delicious, and affordable. I\u2019m honestly surprised that this place isn\u2019t rated higher. My boyfriend and I live nearby and order from Four Seasons on a regular basis and have always had a positive experience. Looking forward to going there in person again!",
            "If there\u2019s a 0 star I\u2019d give that. Please read below\nMe and my friends went to the restaurant few days ago and had the boo dae jeon gol. When we\u2019re 2/3 done, we found a fly in the soup ( with wings and eyes that are black and body with stripes on, slightly bigger than sesame seed). We told the server and she took it back to the kitchen. Soon after that she came out and told us that is was a sesame seed and don\u2019t need to worry about it when it is obviously a bug. Due to the bad service and unwelcoming server, we left almost no tip for that meal.\nLater on when I checked the bank statement I found out that they charged me tips unauthorized the next day we had dinner. So I went in today to figure out if it\u2019s the precharge or it\u2019s actually cashed from the bank.\nThe \u201cowner\u201d (not sure if he is but he\u2019s the cashier) educated me and told me that we \u201cneed\u201d to tip when eating in the US. As far as I know (have been living in the states for over 5 years now), tipping is out of free will. If the service is good of course they deserve tips, otherwise no. I told him that unauthorized charge is a fraud crime according to NYS law and he\u2019s still angry about me not tipping them regarding the service. I was about to go to the police station to file an unauthorized charge of credit card when the owner decided to return the exceeded charge in cash. So i just left afterwards.\nI\u2019m not sure how many times they\u2019ve schemed people like this. But to the people who are going to eat there: be sure to check your bank statement couple days after you eat, and keep your receipt for a few days.\nScreenshot 1 is the card swipe initially on the day we went. Screenshot 2 is the activities from online banking.",
            "This restaurant has a great concept and potential, but fails on the actual delivery.\nFor example: Each table has a cool grill built into the table for the bbq! But then you learn that you have to spend at *least* $45, in food, to actually use it AND they do it FOR you so you don't actually get the experience you thought you were going to. Oh...and \"triple layer pork\" is just bacon.\nBe sure to order dish #42 so you can experience how \"sausage, pork, meat, and veggies w/ tofu in a spicy sauce and noodles (sounds good right?!) turns out to be: hot dogs, bacon, mushy cabbage w/ taste-less tofu and ramen. But don't worry, you won't taste how bad it is because you'll be numbed by the natural endorphins kicking in due to the third-degree burns on your tongue. Oh, and if you're lucky like me you might get the special treat of a piece of bone in your hot dog! Best of luck! Just think of it as a Korean fortune cookie :P",
            "Food was too salty, not that good but it was very expensive for a small quantity. Service was very bad, asked for salad but they said they didn\u2019t have any but another table got salad. Also asked for spoons twice but they never came back to give us any.",
            "Excellent food. Seafood pancake, dumplings, hot stone pot and soondubu were really tasty. Service was quick and attentive.",
            "I didn't come here with high expectations, but the food here was worse than I could imagine.\nI ordered the Cold Noodle and the Ginseng Chicken soup (samgyetang). While ordering I was warned that 'Americans' wouldn't like it, but Koreans and Chinese might enjoy it...that should have been a hint to just leave (I'm half Korean). The soup didn't have any ginseng, garlic, or dates, didn't use the right rice for stuffing in the chicken, and really didn't have any hint that it was anything other than a frozen chicken boiled in salt water. The side dishes were quite bad as well. The kimchee was undermarinated and was overly salty. The cold noodle was edible, but was very plain. The only time the server smiled was when he picked up the cash from us.\nThe store looked like it might serve authentic Korean food, but don't be fooled!",
            "My No.1 Korean Restaurant in Ithaca. The soups are delicious!",
            "Don\u2019t go! The food safety is a serious issue here. My friend was throwing up in the middle of the night not once but twice after visiting the restaurant for dinner. Did I mention that we only went there three times!",
            "The food was delicious and staff were very nice! This is my second time coming here and both times I loved everything that I ordered. Would definitely eat here again!",
            "I had #59 on their menu, a sauteed kimchi dish with pork, tonight. Most of the pork pieces were fatty pieces of chewy bacon, and the rest looked like left over pork chops shredded and recycled into other dishes, like this one. The menu listed the item as very spicy; it was at best mild to medium heat. The kimchi was remarkably mediocre, the whole dish lacked any substantial flavor beyond that of the smokey bacon after tones that clung like old grease to the back of my mouth. It's possible that I detected a hint of something akin to that of the flavor water takes on, after having hotdogs boiled in it.\n\nI had wanted to try out the korean bbq, but apparently you need to order a minimum of two full entrees and then the staff cooks it in front of you at the table instead of the patrons cooking the meats themselves at the table, as is the norm with most korean bbq places. Good luck with the other dishes, but steer clear of #59.",
            "Went in for lunch, was seated, then waited 10 minutes and left. They were too busy stacking cups and making roll ups to bother to talk to us.  Only one person in the back actually doing anything.  Will never go back.",
            "Rather pricy, and the foods are very mediocre (Unfortunately, other Korean restaurants in Ithaca are terrible).  Service is terrible.  They fraudulently altering the tip on my credit card slip - it was only 10 cents, but I just can't tollerate this.",

            "Ordered a pizza at 12:05am for a 12:46am delivery. Pizzeria said it would be 5-10 minutes twice after 12:46am as it was out for delivery. Drive called at 2:08am to deliver. I declined and the pizzeria will not refund the order.  Hard to be their inability to delivery a timely pizza is now my loss.",

            "I never give one stars but this place really sucked. Ate twice from here as it us really close to my place. The pizza was quite underwhelming for a pizzeria . However, what was really terrible was the terrible value for money on their fried chicken. I was given one big chicken breast and three super tiny wings when there were supposed to be 4 pieces and this was for 7 or 8 bucks . This, when I explicitly said I didn't want wings. It was tasteless too. Just chicken deep fried in oil. This place has nothing going for it. Ostensibly, it has good menu variety but it doesn't have the capacity to deliver on it. For the quality, the prices are too high. Avoid.",
            "I ordered from there last night and Will never order again. I figured I'd give it another try since the last time I ordered was 5 years ago but NO.  The first time my chicken wings were literally raw, and this time they were bright pink and the pizza was not good either. \ud83e\udd22 extremely disgusted. \u2026",

But 50 cent wings all day now thats what I'm talking about.",

The garlic knots only had 5 maybe the size a dollar coin and everything was completely burnt. Needless to say the driver was very rude and careless that the food was burnt and he had an attitude about give me my money back. My advice save yourself from being hungry and order pudgies!",

I have to say the sauce was EXCELLENT - this coming from an NJ Italian =)  Will give them a second chance.  Was 45 min for delivery on a Saturday - pretty average for Ithaca.",
            "We ordered the chicken parm and chicken alfredo. Both were very soupy and oily, it was disgusting. Also, both meals were supposed to come with garlic knots and we did not receive them. Upon calling the restaurant to request the garlic knots that I paid for, the staff member gave me extreme attitude and difficulty. I am a college student here and trying to find decent food late night is difficult but I will never order from this place again.  This rate and review makes you put a star level in order to post the comment but if I could, I would give it 0 stars.",
            "I ordered something called Canadian french fries. I myself am candian. The French fries had gravy on them that tasted like it hadn't been mixed properly. It was the saltier thing I have ever tasted, PURE salt. When I called and asked to speak to the manager I got a man on the phone with an accent. I explained it was too salty and asked if I could get a different order of it another time that wasn't made this way. He said well maybe next time you shouldn't order gravy on it, this is the gravy I use for everything. I said, please do me a favor a taste test your gravy and tell me that it's not our salt. He said well I said next time just don't order gravy on your fries if you think it's too salty. He was extremely rude and in no way wanting to accommodate or meet  in the middle with me. So I said is there a different manager I can speak with, your being very rude. So I said nevermind, I will call tomorrow and speak with a different manager. Thank you, have a nice day. And hung up. Based off of this... I don't think I would ever order from them again.",
            "Wanted to order pizzas on the way through Ithaca, ordered ahead of the time, placed it online. Glad I chose cash. Got there - lights on, food out, even their two \"Open\" signs flashing... But no one there, doors locked. After I got there- had gotten a call from 'Slice' telling me they couldn't confirm, as no one answered for them either.",
            "Found this place listed as \"Ithaca's Latin Food\" on Ithaca to Go. This is CRAZY and a scam. \"Ithaca's Latin Food\" is not a real restaurant. If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I ordered a burrito thinking it was a Latin food restaurant. I got a microwave burrito the size of my palm from the convenience store. I also ordered \"pork\" tacos that were so microwaved you couldn't even lift them from the plate. The sauce that they put on them was marinara on TACOS. Gross. Never again. And very tricky of this restaurant and Ithaca to go to make up a fake restaurant name.",
            "There are (were?) 2 Mamas in Ithaca, one by the college that everyone seemed to hate, and one that took over the old pie place at the bottom of 79 from Enfield into Ithaca.  The pizza there is great.  *If* you like downstate pizza.  If you like thick doughy pizza crust and super sweet sauce, I suggest Matts, or Sal's. (which used to be good).",
            "What tastes like tree bark and costs $4 per square inch? Their terimasu.The smallest portions at the most inflated price. Also take a very lax responsibility to delivery. Food was essentially expired, like in other reviews. And the also sell Pepsi products, not Coke.",
            "Someone BIT our Chicken wing!!! (WTF)  The food was cold,    Mac and cheese was boxed and not even cooked right (you could see the powder mix.  Baked Ziti was like soup and about 10 pieces of ziti. The Ziti Dinner didn't come with garlic rolls as mentioned on their menu on Grabhub.  Tried calling for a refund and no response.",

Toasted to perfection with the right amount of cream cheese. It was delicious.\n\nIt was my first time eating there. There\u2019s so much to choose from. I\u2019ll be coming back for sure.",
            "This place was recommended by some friends and Cornell Alumni. Plenty of space to sit and talk inside. Lots of options (not just bagels). I had a Mexican style garlic bagel and was very impressed. They also had premade meals and plenty of other snacks. I\u2019ll be back!",
            "Glad Collegetown Bagels is still around!  They were smaller and on the other side of College Ave when 30+ years ago.  When I was just there last Sunday, sandwiches were taking 25 minutes - worth the wait, I'm sure.  We opted for toasted bagels with cream cheese, which took only five minutes.  The Irish Cream latte was very sweet.  The Butter Pecan Cocoa was delicious.  The drinks took ten minutes. And the Smores bar was heavenly!",
            "Love this spot! Beautiful atmosphere. SOO many options. Staff very friendly. Quick service. Indoor and some outdoor seating. Highly recommend!",
            "I can understand how this type of quirky place would be the center of a college town \u2014 lots of funky options, a cool building, etc.  But bagels do take an eternity to come out, the cashiers are surly, and honestly the bagels just aren\u2019t that good.  I mean, look, I\u2019m a New Yorker.  I\u2019m going to be hard to please on bagels.  But the lox was bland, the bagels were inconsistent in size and flavor, and they were a bit stale.\n\nSo not bad \u2014 I mean, it was the best option around by far.  But not an amazing bagel.",
            "DELISH!!! I loved the vibe, coffee, bagels and variety. I had to stop myself from visiting a third time before heading back to the Mitten state. Also love that they stock baked goods from Ithaca Bakery, one place to grab goodies from both local gems. I'm with it!",
            "Have been to the area few times, but first visit to Collegetown Bagels, I must say it\u2019s much more than the name says. Lots of varieties, food & beverages are tasty and fresh, service is friendly and efficient. Would recommend you to make a trip here, before considering any other ones. Just minutes away from anywhere in Cornell area. Thank you and keep up with the good job.",
            "Ordered a few things from them today, including: Green Street, Overnight Oats, avocado toast and the big Buck.\n\nThe buck was just.. okay. I was under the impression the peppers or onions would be saut\u00e9ed but they were just raw.\n\nThe green street was good. Oats were fine.\n\nThe avocado toast looked and tasted awful. Let the photos speak for this. I would never serve this to anyone looking like that.",
            "Delicious bagels. The bagel menu is extensive so i took a while to decide. The smooth menu was also big. You can customize the smoothie with whatever fruits you want. However, the smoothie was ok. A bit bland. I'd go for the famous, classic bagels.",
            "Went in College Town Bagel just to see what the talk was all about this place. My son and I had a Brunch at the place and gotta say, my taste buds did not suffer! Love how this business is set up and when leaving having a conversation to talk about the place afterwards. They have wifi for who needs it. Also they have a place to sit outside for people to enjoy eating outdoors! College Town Bagel is located in The Commons of Ithaca NY down town area. Many other restaurants & bar n grill pubs with different culture appeals.",
            "All staff were rude but I could tell that I might have caught them at a weird moment so I let it go. Then I started chewing my coffee. Place seems really nice I just assume I got them at the wrong moment.",
            "First time here in Cornell and I had a hankering for some quick bites. I told myself, where do the college kids go. I stopped by inside and absolutely loved the decor.\n\nI got their round house bagel since it reminded me of nyc's solid sausageeggandcheeseketchupsaltpepper. I thought it would be packed with flavor with the Rosemary bagel, but every bite was almost bland. The sausage didn't have any real flavor. The cheese and the added ketchup I had them put in really carried the bagel.",
            "Average food and coffee, horrible service. The workers we encountered were pretty rude which kind of took us off guard because we thought it was a funky place and we were having a good time. Coffee came out, not as ordered but that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s just coffee. Then after asking at the 17, 21 and 25 minute mark, a nice lady grabbed our food that was in a bag, off the shelf. We had been sitting, waiting and patiently asking if our 2 simple bagels were ready and finally the only nice worker discovers them. Waste of time and the establishment wasn\u2019t even busy.\nAlso, the cream dispenser is horrifically dirty. Please clean those nozzles before some brilliant Cornell student gets botulism.",
            "Ordered a panini and it was burnt, falling apart and soggy. Italian soda was bland with barely any flavoring ( I ordered mandarin with simple syrup and a blt)",
            "Great place for coffee, snacks, sweets and excellent vibe to enjoy the weather. Loved the bagel especially the egg/Pesto one with the coffee.",
            "Great food, although I really don't understand the whole push towards massive salt crystals on rosemary bagels. Eating there is always a treat, in part because of pricing, but it really is good and the staff are nice. 4 stars isn't because it's bad, I just give it because there wasn't anything particularly outstanding either.",
            "Absolutely the best bagel \ud83e\udd6f shop hands down \u2026 I grew up in Brooklyn and I know good bagels\u2026 take it from me this place is worth the stop and the staff\u2026 super friendly. \u2026",
            "Went \u201coff-season\u201d in early August for lunch.\n\nThe food is average. The bagels are a little better than the premade ones from Dunkin Donuts. The sandwiches are for petite people. If you\u2019re from NY and are used to your solid corner bagel/deli spot this place will disappoint you. Good enough for college town I guess.\n\nContrary to some of the other reviews, the service was friendly and nice!",
            "Delicious food, friendly employees, fast service, and an excellent array of options. Highly recommended!!!",
            "Yummy sandwiches and bagels, a staple for Cornell students. They have a variety of options that cater to different diets, including halal. That being said, I deducted a star because who charges $11 for a sandwich especially when your customers are mostly students.",
            "Took a little time, but it was quite busy. That being said the food was delicious and there was a lot of variety!",
            "Great bagel shop, with good variety bagels, sandwiches, soups, yogurts, smoothies, coffee. Wonderful staff!",
            "Iconic college town sandwich shop! I got Mexican bagel on sesame bagel with 6 strips of bacon\u2026yum, yum. And a large hot late.",
            "Over $70.00 for 4 bagel sandwiches and 4 cans of carbonated lemonade is completely unreasonable. 2 of the sandwiches were lox and cream cheese , one was hummus and veggies,  and one was red pimento, mozzarella, and some green, perhaps lettuce. None of them were anything special. There is no waiter staff, you order at a counter and they send you a message when it's time to FOR YOU to pick your order up. Then, when you pay your bill, they have the nerve ask for a tip. You do what you want. I won't be back. These folks are just riding on their long reputation. They don't deserve it at this time.",
            "Nice college town vibe. Good food and reasonably priced. They don't validate parking but instead offer you a discount on your purchase when you show your parking receipt.",
            "love this place, I\u2019m obsessed with it, affordability is in between Dunkin and Starbucks (depending on what you get), they do not up-charge for dairy alternative milks",
            "This place feels like home. Its cozy, crowded, bohemian and serves good food and coffee. I love places like this that have a lot of character and local charm and this is a must visit staple in Ithaca. Yes the college kids are a little annoying but it's their backyard so I can't hate.",
            "Overrated and overpriced. I genuinely cannot fathom the chokehold that Collegetown Bagels has on the city of Ithaca. THIS is the place that kept Dunkin' Donuts from opening a location here? Seriously believe that the only thing keeping this location afloat is their convenient location (proximity to Cornell campus). The service is absolute garbage. Employees are mostly students, and they are *visibly* incompetent. Before ordering, one of the cashiers had informed us that the wait would be around 30 minutes. Well, we placed our order and ended up waiting in line for nearly an HOUR. Had we known how long it would actually take, we wouldn't have ordered at all. The employees were evidently incapable of handling a rush, judging from the constant throng of people hovering around the waiting area. Not to mention, I can't even say that the wait was worth it. The food itself is extremely mediocre, and that's being generous. $40 for a stale a*s bagel (the bread was literally hard as a rock), a mediocre avocado sandwich (with barely any avocado), and some flavorless, watered-down fruit smoothies. All things considered, this place is undeserving of even one star lol. First and last time coming here.",
            "Good place for good sandwiches. Frickin chickin and Milanese are good if you like pesto.",
            "Down the hill from Ithaca College. Lots of selection, good food. Limited seating, slightly pricey.",
            "Food is amazing, service is just as great. We have been everyday since we have been visiting Ithaca. The New Yorker, Italian, and Round House sandwiches are all awesome.",
            "Amazing menu. Great service. Good drink selection too. Nice outdoor seating with shade \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb \u2026",
            "Buy the hype! Delicious and fun. Pictures is the big red pizza bagel. My favorite!",
            "Ordered the Brooklyn on a Rosemary Salt bagel. Bagel was delicious, but the cheese could have used a little more time to melt. Would definitely recommend!!",
            "Very good lunch with my family.  Parking can be a bit tough.  Great sandwiches though and great baked goods.",
            "Offers a wide assortment of bagels, wraps, sandwiches, and desserts along with beer and wine. Great food and ambience. Very popular with the local crowd.",
            "Good coffee & bakery goods. Also enjoyed the happy hour for a beverage after class.",
            "Amazing place. The food was great, and the coffee tasted like it was small batch roasted. The staff were very nice. A bit pricy, but a great treat!",
            "After I got my coffee, I looked for the table where most coffee shops put the milk. Unfortunately, I could not find the milk, so I asked the staff for either H&H or whole milk. The staff replied, \"so you want a latte, which will cost extra dollars.\u201d Her comment shocked me because the other coffee shops never asked me for extra money for milk. The setting and food were great. But good luck to the next person who asks for milk.",
            "Very unreliable with online orders - do not expect your order to be right. Almost every time I order breakfast to pick up - they always miss an extra item I add on. Not only do I get an incomplete sandwich, but I'm still charged for this.",
            "Overrated, expensive, and mediocre food.\nIt's worth to visit the place once just so you can get it off your list of things to do in the Cornell area, but otherwise it's nothing memorable except the fact that you get overpriced mediocre food and coffee  - that part you'll definitely remember.",
            "Great! I usually get the Round House, which includes: bacon, sausage, egg, cheese, and hash browns.",
            "i love the atmosphere and the staff here are lovely! overall a great establishment but a couple of things could be slightly improved. For one, the bacon egg and cheese is lacking in bacon egg and cheese. I feel like for the price, a lot more should be inside the bagel. Right now it looks like a kiddie version of the original BEC. The queens bagel is also wildly inaccurate and honestly a little disrespectful to queens. If anything, the bec is the queens bagel. I have never heard of anyone in queens putting egg salad in a bagel. I might sound a little harsh but this establishment is great! I am just too passionate about nyc bagels. I just wanted to give some advice. I am a forever supporter of CTB but please i cant live with that queens bagel on the board and the disrespect BEC.",
            "Awesome bagles! Fantastic spot to work for students and locals in a coffee shop style atmosphere. They do have great coffee and bagles, but also a large selection of sandwiches, smoothies, and pastries too. I came during the morning, but their draft beer selection was also impressive.",
            "I like the location and staffs there. Also price is reasonable, food is good too l",
            "The food here is very good and there is a great selection of everything for a great and yummy lunch.  However\u2026 waiting for over an hour to get four sandwiches for my family was NOT acceptable.  I waited there on Monday from 1pm to 2pm+ with a huge crowd of other customers.  Those who ordered just one sandwich were served quick while those with large orders (four sandwiches?) had to wait.\n\nInstead of pausing orders and helping out the kitchen, they simply kept taking more orders and getting more backed up. Sloppy way to run the place. Yes I will return here but the service was TOTAL disappointment.",
            "Everything was good\n..the lox and capers, tomato ,onion etc\nThe regular bagels\nThe canolis\nThe baguette\nThe ciabatta\n...the vibes\n..the village\n\nVery worth the stop !",
            "I ordered Sufganiyahs because I saw a new program about them.  I live in Wichita, KS and ordered and hadi them shipped to me.  They are incredible!!!! This will be our new family tradition and definitely from this bakery.  Thank you for adding to our holiday happiness:)",
            "The food and drinks were fine, but I went for happy hour and the bartender didn\u2019t tell me until after he poured my beer that it\u2019s the only one not at the happy hour discount.  I wish I\u2019d left it on the counter and just left, that seems like the kind of thing you should mention before you pour the drink.  Gonna have to triple check with them from now on.",
            "This place is a staple for my family ( read: bagel loving NY native dad) when we come to visit. Holy cow the new location is HUGE, and the options are almost overwhelming and too much. Great for a quick bite anytime of day. Also, desserts, and a bar full of cool looking IPA\u2019s. The staff is super friendly and positive and I love supporting local business!\n\nI agree with the 11$ a sandwich commenter below me, but that is the going rate unfortunately, maybe throw in a bag of chips.\n\nAlso, the Udi\u2019s GF options are lame (especially for an added fee\u2026), I want some of your homemade creations not a boring old plain Udi I can buy from the store.",
            "I visited Cornell for a day and started my morning at CTB. Cool university atmosphere and a huge verity of breakfast choices.",
            "i swear to god this place has given me food poisoning twice.",
            "I love how lively this place is, no matter what time you go! I very much enjoyed the breakfasts I had here. It's just it could be a bit crowded as per Ithaca's standard. I especially love the outdoor seats. The big buck warp and the Riviera wrap are my personal favorite, and they are good filling.",
            "CTB has very good options and very tasty food. The only negative thing I have to say is this though. I\u2019ve been ordering regularly for the last 2 years and almost every time I get something some part of my order is wrong. I order one type of bagel and I get another. I get a medium soup and they give me a small. Maybe it\u2019s an online ordering problem but every time there is something slightly off. I hope that one day that gets fixed",
            "Great meal!\nVisited with my wife and son while on a college visit. There's plenty of options and a decent vegetarian/vegan selection. All the of us went for different types of food and everyone left happy. I would definitely recommend for a quick bite. All the staff were friendly and helpful.",
            "Reuben panini saved my life on a frigid day.",
            "Positive: The bagels were great. Nicely toasted. Good amount of cream cheese. Negative: The service. It's very disorganized. I ordered, however I wasn't given a number nor did they ask for my name. A worker there got irritated because I was standing near the salad bar waiting for my bagels. I was just waiting till they called them out, but I guess it's not a good place to wait. I didn't wanna be in other people's way. Also, where it says to 'place order here' isn't for drinks; ordering something like coffee is at the register where people go to pick up food. However, I don't think there's a sign about where to pick up food. It's just a generally confusing place for a new customer. I genuinely feel bad those that work there; they probably feel like traffic cops.",
            "Ive been coming here since forever ago. I stopped in this morning to grab my usual nova lox with cream cheese on the salted rosemary and a drink. The lady at the sandwich station was bursting with positive energy and kindness. Spiked collar and all! Kudos to her...\nAhhhhh but here we go down to the coffee station and \"ole fussy pants\" was my next person. Sheesh, she should have just taken the day off if bothering her about coffee choices was such an inconvenience! Needless to say the signage board for coffee options is far left and facing in a manner that doesn't lend itself to my poor vision. Sooooorrrrrrrryyyyyy! Her tone, her responses, and her attitude was so condescending and off-putting I'da just rathered got my usual (remember? nova lox/cream cheese) and left. Unfortunately, since I was waiting and interested in a coffee OPTION I mustered through her negative vibe and quickly left to the pay station.\n\nThe whole setup is wild - not as welcoming as the old spot across the road.\n\nRegardless, spending close to $30 for some bagel sandwiches and some coffees, and then getting that pessimistic service is a hard no for me dawg. Hard no!\n\nI know I'm only one customer - who cares, right? But I'll spend my $ elsewhere moving forward. Deuces!",
            "Very frustrated. There is not a big Portuguese population where I live, so I spent a lot of money through Goldbelly for \u201cFolar de Pascoa\u201d which is a traditional Easter Portuguese bread\u2026with hard boiled eggs baked into it. I was excited to not get a massed produced version only to find out it was NOT Folar de Pascoa. It was Massa which is plain Portuguese Sweet Bread that is made all year long. What makes it Folar de Pascoa is the hard boiled eggs. That\u2019s why it\u2019s specific to Easter.\n\nTo top it off, it wasn\u2019t even sweet. This was total false advertising and I could have gotten Massa for a heck of a lot cheaper from any actual Portuguese bakery via mail.",
            "EXTREMELY friendly staff and pretty good food! Ingredients were fresh and all, but the ordering process isn't so straight forward if you've never been.",
            "Tasty (slightly expensive) drinks! We ordered the ultimate grilled cheese and the pizza bagel. The grilled cheese was great, but the bagel was very underwhelming. The cheese was just a slightly melted slice.",
            "Love this place. During grad school, I spent way too much money here holed up at Collegetown Bagels studying and just absorbing the environment. Has the classic crunchy granola feel of Ithaca and love that it's a local small business. Prepare for long lines, crowded seating with lots of Cornell students, and great conversation.\n\nAwesome coffee brewed to perfection, incredible bagel sandwiches, and all the desserts you could ever dream up.",
            "We went there for breakfast. Their bagel sandwiches and coffee was very good. I can not say they are the best bagels I have ever had but better average for sure. But I need to say that, their outside space is unbeatable. Luckily we were in Ithaca on a sunny day and enjoyed the view of the university from our table.",
            "I have slowly gotten used to the new location across the street from the old one. Nice patio. Food and drink as good as ever. Less seating indoors. This building used to have a bicycle store and ice cream place. Glad CTB stayed in Collegetown.",
            "** Closing Summer 2020! Visit while you can! **\n\nI've loved Collegetown Bagels, and especially the Collegetown location since I was a student at Cornell. Usually busy, this is a great spot to grab a quick bite, get a deliciously customized coffee or smoothie, and try out any of the weirdly named sandwiches.\n\nAn outdoor area with plenty of seating is great for people watching or just catching up with friends, studying, or hanging out. I will miss this place!",
            "Great food. Nice atmosphere. I felt a little rushed at the counter ordering but it might be because there are sooo many things on the menu to choose from it's kind of overwhelming.",
            "these sandwiches blew my mind, I got the Winner\u2019s Circle and it did not disappoint!",
            "As long as you know what you're getting into Collegetown Bagels is an amazing experience every time. The only reason I say this is because it seems like they are always extremely crowded and busy, music is always playing and people are talking pretty loud. So if you're looking to do some quiet studying it may not be the best place to go depending on when you go there. That being said this place is absolutely a gym in the area. I love the food, the coffee is good and in the warmer months you can even sit outside. If you're into people watching it's a pretty fun place to go with your friends. I highly recommend this place if you go to visit Ithaca.",
            "Good coffee, good food, cool atmosphere if you don\u2019t like to hear yourself think (most of the time). The staff is cool, and they have a ton of very healthy food options, in comparison to what\u2019s available to eat in Collegetown, or Ithaca period, for that matter. Kudos.",
            "My absolute favorite breakfast place in this town. The bagels are always perfectly cooked. And my boyfriend says the breakfast sandwiches are great too. Try some of the specialty coffee options, they are really delicious. All around five stars.",
            "CTB is an absolute staple of Collegetown. They have a great variety for everything! Tons of bagel choices to suit any type of meal you\u2019re going for. They have an extensive drink menu of coffees, teas, smoothies, and milkshakes. Their dessert/pastry case is giant and they swap them out frequently so there\u2019s always something new. The new location is very clean and nice. I love to see that they\u2019ve found a way to stay in the heart of Collegetown. Prices are reasonable and the quality is never subpar.",
            "I always enjoy Collegetown Bagels, the food is very good, and their selection of treats and different drinks is delicious. My only complaint is that it can often take quite a long time to get your order. Whether you're ordering just a drink, or a sandwich with it as well, the service is not very fast. I imagine that's because they put a lot of effort into making sure their food is delicious. I would highly recommend it, but it is not as good for a quick stop. If you are in a time crunch, I would not suggest it. But if you have more than 15 minutes, it's a great option! Also check out their pre-packaged foods and hot bar, they are always very good!",
            "Like it here! Good place for grabbing a coffee or having a light bite.",
            "Yeah it\u2019s been more than 6 months but this store keep me remember of racism! \ud83e\udd28\nIt was last summer, end of July.\nI ordered 4 bagel sandwiches and it literally took more than half an hour.\nI mean if this happened to everyone, I would understand.\nBut there were 4-5 teams got their sandwich ahead of me!\nSo I asked to the some kind of manager looking guy and he was just simply saying without any apology saying, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know sir~\u201d\nI clearly saw him answering other people and treating them well and for answering my question was like 5 seconds with the face of \u2018well I dunno~ lol\u2019\nAnd I waited another 10 mins.\nAnd the food was freaking salty!\nI would never ever go to this place and I suggest some where else folks!\nEspecially, if ur not American.\nDisgusting place",
            "Good bagels - even better coffee. Its located near Cornell University and they have a lot of space but the place is so popular it gets packed quickly. I ordered a bagel called the Roundhouse and it has all the meats plus a hashbrown ! Absolutely delicious.",
            "Nice atmosphere, but can get very crowded during mealtimes (especially right in front of the main entrance, where a lot of people stand to wait for hot drinks).  Sandwiches and pizza bagels are all quite good, if a bit expensive.  Service is generally good, but my order has been forgotten on more then one occasion.",
            "A must-see stop for anyone coming to Ithaca. It's a local staple and it's easy to understand why with their vast food and drink menu. The bagels are good, but not great. I am particularly fond of all their bagel breakfast sandwiches (which you can order all day). The sandwiches are big and filling; however, some of them are a bit overpriced. They have seasonal drinks that are incredibly satisfying like the Catwoman (lavender tea latte with honey) and the Liz Lemon (a mandarin lemonade). The quality of your drink does depend on the barista preparing it. They are open pretty late, which is not that usual in Ithaca and they have a wonderful patio you can sit in when it is warm outside. My main concern is that the service can be really slow, even when there are few customers. If you are in a rush, do not come here thinking it will be ready fast.",
            "Ithaca staple, consistently deliver good coffee, have a solid pastry selection (go first thing in the morning if you want the best selection because they sell out quick) , and the staff is great",
            "Cool place with a big and creative selection\nThe place was rundown looking but it gave it some charm. The staff was a little blunt but they were college aged young folks so I don't take offense when they're making bagels and smoothies at 10pm with no enthusiasm left. I still enjoyed my food and the place.",
            "It was not a single dollar sign... The food was good but the method of ordering wasn't suitable for a large group it seemed optimized for individuals. You ordered main dish in one place, sides, drinks, and desserts at another then paid. A little bit complicated and required too much communication  in a noisy and crowded environment. Our meal was expensive but good. They serve dessert and alcohol. The outdoor eating area smelled of garbage. They need to do a better job cleaning their cans.",
            "California sunrise is a personal favorite. Best bagels in general in Ithaca. Also great coffee. Much cheaper than Starbucks. Lines can get long but they're always extremely well staffed. Unfortunately it's going to be demolished anyday as original construction was set for like June 8 give or take a couple days so go while you can.",
            "The New Yorker sandwich was awesome.  Both my sons were impressed by the Pizza Bagel (unanimously \"the best pizza bagel I've ever eaten\"). After graduating 36 years ago, still the best sandwich shop (not on wheels) @Cornell.  Thanks for bringing back so many great memories.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a \u2026",
            "Great selection of food! They have separate vegetarian and vegan menus. The smoothies are kind of expensive, but they are quite good. Bagels are \ud83d\udc4c \u2026",
            "We had an event at Cornell and needed to get a bunch of coffee. The staff were SUPER helpful, they all offered to help carry things out to my car. They were even accommodating by helping us get vegan milk substitutes. They ended up wheeling a cart out to my car and helped load everything in. Thank you guys SO much, you were all excellent on a day where everything was chaotic.",
            "The last time I was here was 30 years ago so things have changed but it\u2019s an impressive operation now. Bagels are still excellent. The menu is overwhelming but there\u2019s something for everyone.",
            "Their pastries and pound cakes are worth every cent. I really enjoy their asiago bagel (seasonal). Their pizza bagel is delish. It's usually pretty full and in a couple of months will close for construction/renovation work. I'll definitely miss it. Friendly employees. They have lots of choices for both food and beverages and also carry different breads, pre-sliced in case you want to take some home. Lots of seating in and outdoors.",
            "Great sandwiches and drinks. However, might I make a suggestions to the owners of these locations? I noticed a similarity between the collegetown bagels and Ithaca Bakeries: A lot of the food, mostly baked goods and foods that have been refrigerated, have a similar taste lingering in them like freezer burn or when you store two foods too closely together and one absorbs the taste and smell of the other, and I'm wondering if it's related to the coolers they're stored in. It's becoming a bit of a turn off from certain products that I think would otherwise be enjoyable.",
            "Ah, CTB.  The true paragon of college life in Ithaca.  What more can be said that has not already been sung?\nBut seriously, though.  The menu is huge, encompassing everything from a simple bagel with cream cheese (get the Long Island, their version of an everything bagel) to vegan sandwiches to the Big Red Pizza Bagel.  They have a wide range of coffee and tea drinks, as well as seasonal favorites that rotate in spring and fall.  In addition, they serve beer, ice cream, soup, milkshakes, and smoothies, and I'm sure I'm forgetting what all else.  The shop can get VERY BUSY, especially during 11:30-1:00 during the academic year, so you may end up waiting up to 30 minutes for a sandwich, but I assure you it's worth it.  If you're in a rush, you can call in an order on the phone or place it online for pickup.  There is a moderate amount of indoor seating, as well as an extensive patio.  Food can either be picked up at the bar to go or brought to your table (although this is the only table service - if you want anything else, you'll have to go back to the counter).  An Ithaca staple.",
            "It's a staple of Collegetown, and for good reason. There's a wide variety of food and drink to pick up, and for excellent prices. Besides bagels there are also pastries like cheesecake and donuts available, also for great prices. The only downside is that it is usually very crowded, but it doesn't change the excellent food available here.",
            "Good bagels , but horrible and disrespectful service. Every time we go here we have to wait forever to have someone to take our order and then wait forever for someone to get our bill. When we order the employee always puts on this face. This women called Victoria was for some reason so annoyed with us that she ignored our simple question on what bagels there were and gave us this face when we were trying to finish our order. And then while we were waiting for our order we were told there was no ingredient for our bagel. This is not our first experience of horrible service with an employee here. I would really recommend the manager to work on employee training or we would not be coming back for this type of treatment.",
            "What an awesome coffee and bagel shop. Very extensive menu. The lox options are loaded with lox; absolutely fantastic. The staff is very friendly and inviting.",
            "Delicious!\nHad Vegetarian burger and a sandwich - superb and tasty. Cannot wait for my next trip when I would love to sample the rest of the menu.",
            "My feelings fluctuate about this spot depending on the day... it is mostly solid though, and good enough that I frequent it almost weekly.\n\nPro: Gluten free and dairy free bagel and sandwich options.\nCon: A bit on the expensive side\nPro: Most people making the sandwiches make them with enough stuff on it to be worth the price\nCon: Sometimes it smells like burning\nPro: I've never been served anything that smells like burning\nPro: Hard Cider on tap occasionally\nPro: Ben and Jerry's Dairy-free ice cream for sale in the unassuming freezer in the back by the bar... who knew...\nPro: Mostly awesome people working there",
            "Such great bagels! Staff was so very helpful when I asked for recommendations. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of room to sit inside, so if it's raining, be prepared to take your bagels to go.",
            "a great local place. always crowded and food takes a while to get to you. their bagel sandwiches ares so good (love the Brooklyn), and so are their other sandwiches like the Zabs. a must-go-to place when in Ithaca Commons or College town.",
            "The food is good but the service can be a little slow due to their strange system of ordering.",
            "Amazing bagels and coffee!",
            "The amount of stuff this place has on its menu is absolutely mind blowing so prepare to stand there for 15 minutes trying to figure out what you want. It\u2019s also not just a bagel shop and transforms into a bar at night",
            "It's a great place for a bagel, sandwich or some coffee. Tasty food. I'm a vegetarian and they've got plenty for me. At the same time, loads for meat eaters too. At night, it turns into a good place to hang out with some beers or sangria. They've got it all.",
            "They have good food. Really good soup, and if you're a vegetarian they have great options. But the service is absolutely horrible. I would not go here if I was in a hurry. They take way too long to make items. You'll be waiting there for 20 min just to get a sandwich",
            "Looks great. Nice live music. Only sandwiches+ type stuff.\nGreat seating, mostly outside. Have heating for outside, nice.\nNicely decorated but not fancy.\nWould recommend \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc90 \u2026",
            "\u2764\ufe0f",
            "After moving away, I still long for their delicious sandwiches, interesting coffee concoctions and great study atmosphere. I love stopping here on bagel Tuesdays! The Patrick Ewing sandwich might be my favorite and it's not even on a bagel! Apple, brie, and this amazing spicy mustard I have not been able to find anywhere all spread on a crusty baguette - yum!",
            "In addition to the small portion of bacon I received, the bagel was stale and dry.  Not to mention, the egg tasted and looked like a McDonald\u2019s egg. While I did not taste the cheese at all. I do not recommend the \u201cBrooklyn\u201d bagel and it is not a good representation of the well known area. Please save your time and money to drive to the nearest McDonalds.",
            "The CBLT was a great lunch sandwich, the perfect mix of avocado, lettuce, tomato and bacon. The Ice coffee was well made and very drinkable. The Service was relatively fast considering the crowd and the ability to use android pay was very convenient.",
            "A very aestheticly pleasing coffee, bagel and bakery shop! Everything I've had is very delicious with so many options to try. Definitely a place you would want to go on a trip to Ithaca.",
            "Love CTB but they gave me a cold croissant with raw mushrooms when I ordered the Cayuga Croissant..?? This is unacceptable.\n\nOtherwise, the Viva Chelsea panini-pressed and the Cali Sunrise are my two favorites.",
            "I'm enjoying a Collegetown right now. The addition of avocado to the normal line up this excellent. I'm up at the Collegetown location I'm only giving them four stars because down at the Meadow Street, Ithaca Bakery, location; they refused to take my free coffee cards because I had two or three different cards and the clerk insisted that all the stamps had to be on one card. I really needed the coffee that day because I was broke. This happened over 3 years ago but I still remember...",
            "Rosemary salt bagel was not impressive.  Too salty for my taste.  Do try the lox and cream cheese.  Fresh and yummy.  Free water for you while you wait.  Pizza bagel (big red) was alright.  Stick to just bagel with flavored cream cheese and you won\u2019t be disappointed.",
            "Good customized bagels, excellent customized smoothies.",
            "Great employees, Great Bagels, Great Coffee, Treats and Signature Drinks.  Unique to Ithaca area, its one of the better businesses that you can count on for quality service and food.  Highly recommended.",
            "Wonderful experience, lots to look at, cool vegan options",
            "Great place to eat and have coffee anytime of the day. Wide selections of sandwiches, drinks, snacks and deserts. Would highly recommend their TUSCAN VERDE sandwich (Chicken Breast, pesto, spinach, tomato, provolone on focaccia), Tiramisu and Salted Caramel Vanilla Crunch Cake.",
            "JAVI sandwich. Next time I want to try it in a melt. Excellent service, quick for how busy it is. Delicious Cookies. Chip variety on point. Very unique drink selection. Overall highly Recommend!",
            "Edit: after eating here many times there seems to be a difference in quality than what i experienced the first 3 times of eating here. I got a round house without bacon and i got a brooklyn with almost no bacon and it was burnt. Most of the times I eaten here it was fine but ... sometimes bagel sizes are small and there are bacon issues...\n\n----------------------\n\nThe food here is pretty good, but it's a little expensive. It's great if you want to eat something but aren't too hungry.\n\nSometimes the food takes a long time to prepare, but it's usually fast enough to not have to wait too long.\n\nOut of all the times I've been here, the bagels were fresh and not hard.\nBut I only tried the Rosemary Salt Bagel (which I hated the first time because it was super salty but got used to it afterwards and it's as good as I heard lol) and the Plain Bagel.\n\nHowever, one time I ordered the roundhouse and it didn't have bacon in it which made me sad.\n\nThe sometimes long wait even during non-busy hours and the non-inclusion of the bacon in my roundhouse made me subtract a star.",
            "A staple for every Cornell student. There is a huge selection of different bagels and sandwiches to choose from with really nice seating inside and outside. This place is always packed with college students and it's a great late night spot.",
            "Their made to order sandwiches are awesome! Great coffee too",
            "Lots of delicious options for food, drinks, and pastries! Staff is also super nice",
            "The prices are a little high, but when you think about the overhead they need to produce the sheer VOLUME of choices they provide, well, you get what you pay for. The chutney wrap was delicious. The desserts were alright, although I was charged the wrong amount for an eclair, and with no receipts given, and the line packed up behind me, I just shrugged and moved on. It's pretty good, and a must-see if you're new to town",
            "There is a reason this place has endured for decades - and will for the foreseeable future. Everything is homemade, fresh, and absolutely delicious. Fingers crossed that all future generations of Cornellians are able to experience this place - true embodiment of Ithaca.",
            "An Ithaca Institution for over 40 years, they still make some of the best sandwiches in town and now they have beer and wine too.  Great place to sit indoors or out!",
            "CTB is a Collegetown staple.  Everyone knows, everyone goes.  Large menu, LOTS of options, coffee's, smoothies, bagels, sandwiches- Sweet Rachel on Multi-Grain is my favorite. Outdoor seating. This place can be super busy at times- even so the wait is usually 15min or less.",
            "I'm from Ithaca but I live in Cleveland and have for a while. I always rant and rave to people about how much better New York bagels are, and Collegetown Bagels is an embodiment of that. I always refer anyone who's going up state to them. I try to come home once a year and every time I do, even of it's for a weekend, I try to go here at least twice. I've been around the states and never seen a bagel shop like this. It's delicious, there's at least a hundred options to choose from, and nothing ever disappoints. You can also get sandwiches and other food if you're not craving a bagel, but you'd have to be crazy to pass their bagels up. By far the best bagel shop I've ever been to in the US.",
            "Very good bagels, breakfast sandwiches, and coffee! Don\u2019t let the long lines worry you! They are very organized and have a good system for getting orders out fast.",
            "Owned by the same families for sometime, CTB was a station on the .... for my early Highschool days in Ithaca.   Loved their salt bagels and Long Island bagels.   This location and the one on Elmira Road have changed (see expanded) quite a bit over the years.   This location is smaller and more shotgun by necessity. Bagels and sandwiches are yummy.  Great place for a quick lunch bite or late night snack.   Perfect size and shape for the Cornell demographic.",
            "Solid bagel shop. People are friendly here, and the vibe is really nice. Bagels aren't quite up to par with Jersey, but hey, what can you do. All the different sandwich options are still really good.",
            "Loved the vibe -- loved the \"autumn sky\"",
            "For those who cannot eat gluten, they can make paninis with GF bread. This is a little piece of panini heaven!",
            "Really cool spot with solid vegan options!  In a couple visits, I had a nice wrap with seitan and avocado, a giant bowl with quinoa, brown rice, avocado, kale, falafel, tofu, and sesame seeds, and built my own smoothie with berries, bananas, spinach, avocado, and soymilk.  Friendly and helpful staff too",
            "If not for the patio or a raving sugar craving I would never come here. Dessert case is best in the neighborhood but not very fresh. Except the cookies. They're full yum.",
            "This place is extremely disorganized and overpriced for moderate quality food. I ordered four bagel sandwiches and they forgot the last one so I had to wait an extra 15 minutes for it. When I opened mine, the bagel was so small, it looked like a supermarket frozen bagel. No wonder they hide the bagels so you can\u2019t see them when you order. Definitely not worth the money.",
            "Fantastic sandwiches, delicious (powerful) coffee, and the bagels and cream cheese are both top notch. Very fun vibe with comfortable seating and excellent customer service!",
            "Thank you for the wonderful review and all the \u2b50\ufe0f \u2018s",
            "CTB is always good if you can time it so you don't hit the lunch rush. Even then, things move swiftly. I don't think there has been a sandwich there that I have not liked. There is a fair amount of vegetarian options as well. Viva chelsea is go to favorite as well as the California Sunrise.",
            "Large cafe, bakery, sandwich shop, and ice cream parlor in one. Large variety of items to choose from. Pesto sandwich was okay, not overly flavorful. They carry Purity Ice cream. Sandwich portion sizes are so so, on the light side.",
            "Great food, good menu selection, friendly staff. Outdoor seating is dog friendly. We'll definitely stop again next time we're in town.",
            "The Gluten Free sandwich bread and bagels are small, dry, and tasteless -- and sometimes next to empty. The GF wraps haven't been available for over a year. For this they charge $1.50 extra. Some days no GF soup option.",
            "Little disappointing.  My sandwich was given to a gentleman named don, (mine is Matt) after opening it he did gave it to me.  My smoothie was someone else's that never picked it up. Melted and not desirable",
            "Good food and a wide selection of all sorts of goodies.  There is a (expensive) salad bar, and a huge menu of various sandwiches and bagels.  They are almost always busy, and with that, the service can sometimes feel a bit impersonal and rushed.  The food almost always makes up for it though.",
            "The employees just assume that you've been there a thousand times and that you know where to go to order food or drinks which have separate lines that are not easily marked. Their coffee is boiling hot and their service is unwelcoming. If I am in town again, I will not be returning to this establishment",
            "My favorite bagel spot. Literally the best bagel sandwiches on the planet. One time they ran out of rosemary salt bagels - which *almost* cost them a star in this review.  Please just stock extra bagels.",
            "Amazing bagels with great hot/cold sandwich options. Try their panini (I love this frickin chicken). They have great coffee drinks, plenty of grab and go options, and plenty of seating. Can get busy so be prepared.",
            "The bagels were fresh and the servers were great! I also loved the coffee! It would be great from an environment point to change from paper plates to glass or plastic.",
            "A decent coffee shop with tasty bagels and quick foods (including desserts and milkshakes/smoothies), a fun decor, acceptable coffee, and awful internet with speeds from the mid-2000s. Can get busy, but it's still a fine study spot if you have headphones.",
            "By far the best bagel place outside of NYC. It is extremely popular with Cornell students - for good reason! Everything I have ever ordered has been delicious.",
            "Have had a range of things here and have always left satisfied. Can get crowded, but that's to be expected when it's so close to campus. I recommend the Yo Beef and make it spicy!",
            "A Cornell institution: anything you can possibly imagine on any kind of bagel you can possibly imagine.\n\nFavorites include the Turkey Hill BLT, anything on a rosemary salt bagel, and the once-famous special Patrick Ewing. If they won't make it still, do yourself a favor and ask for it by ingredients... peppered turkey, brie, spicy honey mustard, and apple on baguette.\n\nInsider tip: come for a pitcher of beer or sangria on the patio on a sunny day!",
            "I've had my order forgotten twice out of my last three trips and started after 30-40 minutes. I know they're busy but it's really turned me off ctb. *edit* they gave me the wrong bagel *edit 2* the hash brown was still partially frozen.",
            "Great location and great food! There was a wide selection of foods and drinks so there is likely to be something for everyone. The bagels, of course, are the highlight. Highly recommend!",
            "Thank you for all the \u2b50\ufe0f",
            "Waited for 15+ min for my smoothie, missed the bus and the smoothie didn't have a great taste. I had the fruit wellness smoothie. When I asked how long it would take she said it'll be right there and it took 10 more minutes.",
            "Historic shop and great vibes. Can\u2019t go wrong with the Pinot nawara sandwich. Good happy hour beer deals as well.",
            "Very nice place to grab a quick lunch after visiting Cornell university! We had a toasted garlic bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese and the \"all Betty's fave\"!",
            "I've been leaving so many bad reviews, I decided I'd better start testing places I like. This place is always a pleasure to visit, which  explains its popularity. Nice food, coffee,  service.",
            "So much tasty food, from a bagel with cream cheese to a big tasty sandwich with pastries or ice cream for dessert. Too many faves to pick just one.  I love CTB!",
            "While visiting my daughter,she invited me to go to Collegetown Bagels. I was very impressed with their vast selection of items. I was satisfied with my meal and service. I will add Collegetown Bagels to my list of places to visit.",
            "Amazing. That's all that really needs to be said for CTB.\n\nCTB is eternal--it's the one spot that will remain unchanged in all its perfect glory even after the apocalypse has erased every other trace our our civilization.\n\nMillions of delicious bagel and sandwich options, and you can split pitchers of sangria with friends in the evening as well. Get some bagels, some alcohol, and reconnect with friends over old memories while making some news ones as well.",
            "Probably the best sandwich/salad/bakery joint in all of Ithaca.  I eat here at LEAST once a week and I'm not even a permanent resident...",
            "Great bagel place! The choice is actually overwhelming (NB: salmon is Lox). The staff is incredibly welcoming and nice, and the venue is laid back and perfect to enjoy lunch.",
            "Friendly service, awesome food and if you get a chance try the baked potato soup with a rosemary salt bagel!!!! So good and homey - it was Wednesday don't know if it's regular but it was good. :)",
            "Expensive and offers small quantities. I\u2019ve tried their wraps and they taste okay but it\u2019s too pricey. I would rather an Einstein Bagels open up there.",
            "Good place to grab outdoor drinks with friends. The bagels are a little pricy for me but most people really like them. Overall a good place to eat and visit.",
            "Bagel tuesdays and bagels are the best part - bagels and monthly flavors have redefined my idea of a good bagel, comparable/better to many NYC bagel establishments in chewiness of crust and softness of interior, toast really well.

            "WOW. This place deserves 6 stars. If you like szechuan/spicy Chinese food, you NEED to come here. Seriously. Came in half an hour before closing and every single dish was amazing. I'm from NYC, which has no deficit of authentic Szechuan restaurants in flushing and Manhattan, but I can honestly say that this place is one of the best and it's a shame that I don't live in Ithaca to eat here more often. It's the perfect combination of great food and great prices. The prices here cannot be beat. Most of our dishes were less than $20.\n\nThe food: again, every single dish we got was great. Beef stir fried with hot chili peppers, popcorn chicken with chili peppers (la zhi ji), lamb with cumin, and mao xue wan were all 10/10. The egg drop soup with beef was delicious too.\n\nThe owner is really humble and came to ask for feedback after the meal and said that he uses customer feedback to improve their food. But honestly, I would come back just for the food alone. Price is a bonus. Note that they changed owners about 10 months ago.",
            "If you love Sichuan hot pot or dishes \u2026 excellent food in this basement restaurant at Ithaca. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4dDiscovered this place during my daughter\u2019s last semester in Cornell.  We went there like 15 times within a 3 month period. Very memorable and will it miss it lots \ud83d\ude2d",
            "They serve incredible and authentic Szechuan style food with reasonable prices and large portions. Despite the restaurant's name, I'd suggest the menu dishes over the hot pot. Can't go wrong with the mapo tofu or la zi ji",
            "My favourite restaurant in Ithaca!!! Most dishes are very tasty and the price is reasonable too. Best if you come with a big group so that you can try various dishes! Some might find the food too oily though.",
            "Food was cold, numbed mine and my friend's tongues while eating, and gave us both food poisoning the day after.\n\nMenu included a mandatory 15% service charge which feels disingenuous because people will tip after it and I don't get the point of me not being able to decide the tip amount. This in particular because the service was frosty and it felt very unwelcoming.\n\nNot happy with the food quality.\n\nBetter skip and go to any other place nearby.",
            "Been ordering De Tasty for online delivery and I am in love with their lamb dishes which is the Sliced lamb with Cumin Powder Dry Chili with such a wise portion including the white rice and I could eat it for three meals. Yesterday was my first time dining inside the restaurant and inviting two friends of mine to capture this moment of having one of the best meals I've ever had in Ithaca.\n\nI've wanted to have the lamb again but I need to move on this time although my love for the lamb will be infinite still! Lol. I got the Beef with Chili Peller Soup in Dried Pot which was so good, loving the soup, it was even served with vermicelli (I guess?), and the beef was so tender. My friend #1 got my favorite lamb dish and she loved it! I was so glad to know it. My friend #2 got the lunch special of Boiled Fish Filet and Tofu with Roasted Chili Pepper Sauce (starting from 11-2pm if I'm not mistaken) where we could get soup also besides white rice for every entre\u00e9. The fish filet and tofu dish were also scrumptious, the flavor is so rich and the sauce is tempting as you can see it is orange brown bright colored.\n\nThe staff was friendly but some of them have a language barrier which was okay but sometimes it will be hard to understand each other. Recommended to those who want to experience delicious meals that are rich in flavor in Ithaca which was hard to find, at least for me as an Asian!",
            "Food is delicious (id recommend the string beans) service is quick and great. Despite what the name suggests, the menu items are better than hot pot\n\nI have noticed that unfortunately portions have started to decrease in size, which is what prevents me from giving this place the full 5 stars.",
            "Food serves in a very small portion, neither in a good quality. But great in price. Veggies are saggy and not fresh, meat contains great portion of fat. Services are nearly null but interestingly, mandatorily tip you 15% without good attitude. Not recommended.",
            "Nice restaurant, great food and good staff. This is the first time I have dined here, the staff and service is very good. The Hot Pot and jasmine tea were excellent. Cannot wait to try the other meals on the menu.",
            "It is a great taste! It has been so long that I had this tasty Kung Pao Chicken! It comes with a lunch menu of rice and soup with really good price! This will be my place for the next couple of months to try out noodles, beefs and apperatizes.",
            "This was the best Sichuan restaurant my family and I have eaten at ever. There was simply spectacular taste in every dish we ordered, and this is definitely a memorable dining experience. (Also, the photo in the review is at the point where we had eaten halfway through the chicken after a couple minutes, so it doesn\u2019t show the actual portion.)\n\nStarting with the basics, the menu is very well-rounded, the decor is lovely and warm, and the atmosphere is great. My family and I ordered the egg drop soup with minced beef, shredded beef saut\u00e9ed with little hot peppers, sliced lamb with cumin powder, maoxuewang, and smoked wok tossed chicken with roasted chili. We highly recommend all of these dishes, especially the lamb. The prices for these dishes are reasonable, even more considering that the portions are huge but still manageable.\n\nThis is definitely one to add to all of our favorites. You won\u2019t regret taking time to eat in this wonderful restaurant. You can tell that the staff are all hard-working. They also don\u2019t mind chatting with you if you ask them questions, which we did about the restaurant. The food is indeed authentic; just the pleasant smell of the restaurant walking in told us that.\n\nOverall, I don\u2019t know what else to say except that this restaurant is truly mind-blowing. When we all took our first bites into the food, we were surprisingly delighted. Such high levels of crisp, tenderness, spice, authenticity, flavor, seasoning, and feel cannot be replicated elsewhere. I hope that I can revisit this place, even though I do live in NYC. I really won\u2019t forget this experience, and thank you restaurant staff!",
            "Tasty indeed! My favorite restaurant in Ithaca.",
            "Like the dining experience but I need someone with more experience with Thai food too help pick our hot pot items. The meals alone are awesome though.",
            "The food is ok but the price is not the same as the menu. The waitress just said they changed the price. They should have informed me at the beginning! Also, what they claim to be premium meat is not fresh. So, goodbye and good luck!",
            "The hotpot is really bad. The flavor is not even as homemade.\nThe beef and vegetables are not fresh, seasonings are lack, no service at all but takes 15% tips.\nThe environment is also not satisfactory \u2014not clean enough.\nI don\u2019t like it at all!",
            "My friend and I ordered two lunch specials today, which comes with fried rice, two dishes, and hot & sour soup. We ordered both with the mapo tofu and the dry string beans of the four options given. That\u2019s what the special offers online, but it seems like the options are different if you order in person. Anyways, the portion of food was perfect and everything was delicious. The string beans are my favorite menu item and I order them every single time. My only gripe was with how oily the food was, but other than that, it was so delicious. And it was about $12.90 per person, which isn\u2019t too bad (although Apollo\u2019s special is cheaper, iirc).",
            "The only authentic Sichuan place in town, and probably within a 50 mile radius. I ordered Dan Dan Noodles, Mapo Tofu, Pork Belly with preserved vegetables, Twice-cooked pork, and Beef with Scallions and Onions. Not quite spicy enough and slightly pricey but I'm glad I've found a decent Sichuan place in Ithaca.",
            "Added extra spicy to my mapo tofu by accident when requested less spice but otherwise no complaints",
            "This place is so great, I had my birthday here with my family to share a big delicious hot pot and everyone had such a great time.",
            "The place takes a bit of searching to find - look for another restaurant on the street level, and the look for the stairs leading down to the basement level. You'll be glad to have found it though, for the food is great! Atmosphere is certainly not the draw here but you are coming for the food after all, and it is clean and organized. Just don't expect to see a vista of the lake or college town; no windows as it is in the basement. Again - the food, it is what you came for and makes it all worth it!",
            "Pay attention guys, a tip of 15% is already included in your bill (you can barely see it though,  it\u2019s at the bottom of the receipt). This is cheating and I\u2019d never come back again.",
            "The most authentic Chinese food I've had upstate yet. Great vegetarian options with tons of flavor.",
            "Very ok for a hot pot place, the portions are smaller than other restaurants and the selection is smaller. Their spicy broth also isn't spicy at all. On the bright side, you'll be hard pressed to find any other hot pot places up here so it's good if you take that into consideration. Also, it's BYOB",
            "Used to be good. I don't know what happened. The standard has dropped so much. Food quality control is bad. Sometimes the pork just smells horrible that is inedible. I don't know what happened to the rice today, smells so bad. White rice ...",
            "Authentic Szechuan food that blows your mind and tastebuds, friendly staff, and speedy service. I have NO complaints about De Tasty. We regularly bring our small children here, because there\u2019s something for everyone. (I dream about their hot pot)",
            "Very surprised to see this restaurant rated as one of the best Chinese restaurants in Ithaca. The vegitable was way overcooked, and the pork was just leftover.\nBtw, they even charge for take out boxes.",
            "The waitress was really kind and pleasant with us. We were looking forward for some hot pot at this place since it has so many good reviews on here. However, we were served with really bland chicken broth. The Napa cabbage was moldy. We ordered premium pork and shrimp which were all frozen. We really doubt the cleanliness of the restaurant overall since the cabbage came out moldy. Otherwise, I would avoid ordering hot pot here. Overpriced for what it\u2019s worth.",
            "The food was quite tasty, and the experience felt pretty close to the hot pot places you can find in NYC. We were confused trying to get in at first though, because it's in a basement, and the entrance is down some stairs between two other restaurants. That, and the food was definitely a bit overpriced--they raised the prices because of inflation, and while they let us know the prices would be higher than it said on the menu, it was still a bit annoying. They even charged us for the sauce we took. But still overall a good experience with good food.",
            "My favorite authentic Chinese restaurant in Ithaca!! It\u2019s delicious and the hotpot tastes just like it does in China. Everyone who works there is friendly and nice. I went once a week all through college, their spicy beef noodle soup is unbeatable.",
            "The food was EXCELLENT. Authentic, flavorful, and there were so many options to choose from. My only qualms; the pricing on the menu was a bit confusing and it was HOT inside, so wear layers that you can take off! But the food was honestly some of the best Chinese food I've had outside of NYC, and the staff was extremely kind. Definitely coming back!",
            "Last day here in ithica for our honeymoon my husband and I decided to try hotpot. Got there atmosphere was awful\u2026.was way too hot\u2026.far too contained leading it to be too loud almost bar level loud\u2026..waited 20 minutes to just get an order in\u2026.my husband told our waitress he was DEATHLY allergic to mushrooms..broth came with mushrooms\u2026.not once were we checked on. And WAY too overpriced for what it was\u2026honestly could make better hot pot at home\u2026.don\u2019t waste your time or money. Also enjoy that 15-25% automatic gratuity for awful service.",
            "Pretty good food. The owners and waiters are really kind and accommodating, definitely recommend",
            "A different review than most, as my wife and I used them as our wedding caterer! The guests loved the food, which was delivered right on schedule and much more affordable than some of our other options. Of course, it's very tasty too, and one of the better/more authentic local Chinese options. My wife's favorite is the braised pork meat balls.",
            "Served oily appetizers cold.  Chef special chicken w/vermicelli was neck bones and other bone. Also tip 20% was included in bill no notice given.\nAlso service very poor - the staff sat in middle of dining area and eating lunch NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT of.patrons leaving.\nAVOID AT ALL COST. Aug 14 2022",
            "Food is pretty good but they charge you tips no matter how many people there is. We came as a table of three, ordered around $100, and charged us tips! No service whatsoever and they didn\u2019t tell us or anything. Not gonna come again :)",
            "The portion size is pretty large. The food is delicious. This might be one of the best Chinese restaurants in Ithaca. You have to go down into the basement to enter it, but inside its very spacious and nicely arranged. The price is a little bit on the higher side for Asian cuisine.  Overall, I recommend it.",
            "Wonderful soups. It's delicious qnd spicy. You can order vegetables, meat pieces to put that it the pot. In five min, it's ready to eat. Best enjoyable in group, not alone.",
            "Bad experience. Came in with a group of 5, had no communication with a waitress or anything until 40 minutes of waiting. Finally ordered, the broth was tasteless & visually unappealing. Assumed using the sauces in the front would help the taste, and the unknowingly charged a random price for each added sauce. Confronted the manager about it and she laughed in my face. After that experience, the cherry on top was that the tip, to a waitress we barely saw, was already included in the bill. Save yourself time & money!!",
            "The food here is very good and so is the hot pot.  There are so many options at this restaurant and the portions are pretty good for the price.  I really like their soup dumplings and cumin lamb.  In the Cornell area, this is great food!  You will definitely have leftovers after coming here so enjoy!",
            "Took my parents here to try something new in Ithaca. The lunch specials were good but the hot pot was $20/person for vegetables and broth and it really wasn't that tasty. The staff was unhelpful, messed up my order, and was so hot inside it felt like a sauna. Also, they automatically tip themselves so I'm not crazy about that. Probably won't be going back, there are better places to eat.",
            "Undoubtedly the most premier Sichuan cuisine I\u2019ve ever had. With delightfully delectable food, exceptional portions, and incredible prices, this unrivaled establishment is second to none.",
            "I ordered four entries and several sides at 8:00 and it was delivered by 9:00 by a friendly and courteous delivery person. When I got the food into the house I could smell the quality and became hungry. My selections were shrimp with peppers, smoked tea leaves, duck, Szechwan dumplings, and beef stew. All the items exceeded my expectations in flavor, complexity, cuisine preparation skill, and overall quality. The aloe vera drink is fun too!",
            "Came for hot pot with a pretty good sized party and left disappointed and still hungry. Portion sizes on hot pot items are very small and it's very easy to end up paying a lot for what seems like little food.",
            "I feel like this restaurant should come with an instruction manual. Unclear if we were supposed to go to the servers or if they were supposed to come to us. The food was adequate enough, and the ambiance of the warm basement that could double as a roller rink was comfortable.",
            "Great place! I have lived in Asia for a while and have been looking of authentic Chinese cuisine for a while. This hot pot place is exactly that. The food is good and the service fast. Americans who are used to the extra friendly, sometimes devote service, might have to adjust a little bit here but its worth the experience.",
            "Waited over thirty minutes only to be told our order had been lost. The manager refused to offer any compensation, telling us to leave if we weren't happy. They then had the gall to automatically tip themselves, and multiple items on the receipt were priced higher than on the menu. Would not recommend.",
            "Love the hot pot and food. Pancake were oily but rest of the food was great. Service was great too, although earlier I've had trouble as the server didn't really get the order (no egg in rice) and took a long time to replace the correct order ( just fried rice).",
            "The food here is fantastic, and is totally authentic. In addition to the Szechuan cuisine found in most \"authentic\" Chinese restaurants, they also have some traditional foods from northern China like sauerkraut and green bean noodles and \"Ants Climbing On a Tree\". The price is typical for a sit-down Chinese restaurant, and the service is acceptable - not bad enough to make me not want to come here. Come here if you want the best Chinese food in the local area.",
            "I've been here twice with friends, and both times the wait for our food was very long. The second time they lost our order and came out 30 minutes later to get it again. We got hot pots both times. When they finally came out, all of the meats were frozen and pieces were stuck together into one massive chunk. That said, the broths were good, and the veggies were fresh.",
            "Oh wow! What a great find! The spicy vegetable stew was very spicy (perfect for me) and my 11yo son loved the minced beef and noodles. I wish I could take this restaurant back to Arizona with me. I might look for excuses to visit Ithaca again just for this!",
            "Automatic 20% gratuity built in even though they took 20 minutes to seat two people, gave mundane food, and almost zero service.",
            "After being extremely excited to try out a new collegetown restaurant, this place was immediately disappointing. The room was incredibly drafty on a night that wasn't that cold out, the service was poor (took 25 minutes after getting seated to even get a pot let alone food), the vegetables weren't washed. Having gone in mainly to sample many different choices the staff told us they were \"out\" of all the half orders and then proceeded to change and bill us for a full portion of everything. I thought this would have been a fun place to go to regularly but I now have no intention on returning.",
            "the food I ordered tastes ok, but only a very small amount...garlic pork: small portion. beef noodles: little beef. fried ribs: too much fat and bones, little meat, too oily. probably won\u2019t go back.",
            "Love this authentic slice of Sichuanese cuisine in a surprisingly spacious basement restaurant. Clientele is 99% Chinese so you know it's good. Food came immediately. Love their egg tomato noodle soup, Dan Dan noodles, lamb with cumin, and cucumber salad.",
            "Debatably the best Chinese food in Ithaca, although they offer much more than just the typical \u201cAmerican-Chinese\u201d food. This place has good portions, reasonable prices, and the food is top-quality. My go-to for takeout.",
            "Order the whole fish in spicy bean sauce, the  saut\u00e9ed beef onions and scallion, and the Szechuan fried chicken. Great hole in the wall spot with tasty food.",
            "TLDR: Food is great, service sucks. If you're the type of person who considers service more important than food, then this isn't the place for you. This place is authentic Chinese restaurant, in every sense of the word. Not only is the food is authentic, the service is too (and of course they still expect a tip lol). This is a place that takes 20 minutes to get you a spoon, only to tell you that you can pick it up at the middle of the restaurant yourself.\n\nSo why the 4 stars? Because I love the food so much I try to ignore the crappy service. They also have some \"good days\" when they serve you like a normal restaurant would.",
            "Delicious, authentic, family style scezhuan. I spent 20 years in The City dining in Chinatown; this is the only comparable place around ithaca, IMHO.  The staff is friendly and courteous. If you're not in the mood for a leisurely meal, call ahead, to make sure they're not slammed or, for take-out",
            "POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!\nThis restaurant had my wrong order from Ithaca to go and they literally made me call them for hours. I had received a wrong order and they were not willing to redelivery or refund me. I wouldn't recommend ordering from this restaurant. If there was a choice of giving zero stars, I would definitely give them a ZERO.",
            "They make good food here although I haven\u2019t had the hot pot yet. It\u2019s the least Americanized Chinese place I\u2019ve tried so far in Ithaca. Be careful on the stairs though!",
            "Great food, authentic flavor, busy but unique. A real treat, just not very big. If you bring a big party, make sure there's space first. If there is, the hot pot is phenomenal.",
            "The food was disgusting the sweet and sour chicken was so breaded with no chicken and over cooked. My wife had tofu and fish she asked for mild its was hot. The fish tasted like mud. Very disappointing",
            "I\u2019ve never complained about this restaurant. The food comes out great all the time. Downside: pickup only",
            "Had excellent beef noodle soup and dumplings. Plenty of meat with tender and chewy parts and a flavorful and spicy soup base. Nice homemade dumplings.",
            "Early afternoon in College Town. It looks like you're in China Town. \ud83c\udfeb girls giggling, holding hands, in uniforms walking across the street, here. The southwest corner of Eddy and Dryden. Down the street from Classic Optical. Glassed storefront. Inside, menu in Chinese on the wall. Ponytailed smiling girl behind the counter, thick accent but very friendly, cooperative. Very large, comfortable wood tables, chairs with runners up the back, comfortable seating, better than restaurant grade. But there's not many tables. It's a small place, gets crowded very fast. Subway tiles on the walls, everything immaculately clean. A man stepped out from where the food was being made. Even he looked like he was cleaned and pressed. Tall, slender, well-coiffed, in a perfect tee-shirt and suit pants. Smiling as he looked around. Not like a cook. Well-lit. Cozy. Pleasant. Very soft music in the background. Nothing to offend. Huge sealed broad wood spoons and bowls, like laminate. Had a deep bowl of chicken soup, big pieces of chicken breast so tender touching it made the skin on the back fall off. Loaded with water chestnuts, celery, leeks, bean sprouts, rice noodles. My friend rolled her noodles with her chop sticks on the spoon. Not one drop of fat. I couldn't finish it. Neither could my friend. Fabulous. Some of the tables were filled with food. Folks were chowing down. Everyone was happy. Chinese business men in suits. A UPS guy. People reading while eating. Parking lot close-by, just a buck. Best Chinese food in Ithaca. You'll love it.",
            "I always have SUCH a wonderful time here whenever I go. It's the best Chinese food in the area and the people there now not only recognize me but also memorized my order. They always have the best food and try their best to take care of you. Reminds me a little bit of home!",
            "3 mins walk from my apt and have been here for at least a dozen times. Really nice, authentic Szechuan food at affordable price. The food quality is consistent over times. The go-to place for me and my friends",
            "Bad service and it's not the language barrier, as I am asian. The hot pot kept shutting off during the meal and we had to wait super long to cook anything. Some of the staff didnt help at all and even reprimanded us for fiddling wih the built -in stove.",
            "Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious! Lots of vegetarian options! Can't wait to try more! Really appreciate that they're doing curbside pickup!",
            "Super delicious food and such a large selection! Definitely need ti come back to get hot pot!",
            "Excellent food and wonderful service - had a delivery mix-up with GrubHub and they went and delivered it to us instead with no hassle while being extremely courteous and kind -  above and beyond! Thank you so much, will be ordering again!",
            "I go there at least once a week. Large variety and decent taste. Also spacious and cozy at the same time.",
            "Good hot pot. The portions are a little small, but the prices are reasonable. The sauce bar could use a little more variety.",
            "this is like the shangri-la of ithaca. really captures the whole \"hole in the wall\" aesthetic. it's a little pricey, especially if you get the hot pot, but otherwise entrees are fantastic",
            "Only good Szechuan option in Ithaca that I've seen. Great food (didn't try the hot pot).",
            "Food is average. The place is in a basement. The big issue is the way they treat customers - the manager interrogated me when I tried to pay with a gift card, claiming that it was expired (even though there was no expiration date.)",
            "They redeemed themselves! Gave us the wrong food and proposed some odd workarounds but ended up making everything come out even. Great food",
            "Really NASTY! There were DIRTY STRINGS (probably spider web) in their water glasses. We pointed it out, and the waitress DIPPED HER FINGERS in the water to remove those strings. 4 friends and I, we all see it and she DENIED IN OUR FACE.",
            "Just ordered, and I enjoyed a serving of rubber that was flavored like sesame chicken.  Husband got egg drop soup, which was okay.",
            "Twice cooked pork, flounder in dry pot, dumplings in chili oil and cumin lamb were quite good.",
            "It was the worst food the sweet and sour chicken with all breading no chicken my wife ordered her food not spicy she could barely eat it it was so spicy overall it was some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had",
            "Amazing, get the dry string beans, dan Dan's and wok smoke chicken w chilies!!!!@#$%",
            "Nice atmosphere, but pretty expensive for more than 2 people to eat hot pot",
            "Pretty decent hot pot. Great place if you want some more traditional Chinese dishes",
            "Great experience and good food.",
            "The hot pot is really fun, but even if you decide not to do it, their normal foods are awesome too!",
            "Price was different than the menu shown. Was told that they use prices from a different menu. Ended up paying more than double what it would cost\u2026.",
            "the Hot Pot: really expensive for them just giving you broth and ingredients...\nThe lunch specials were tasty",
            "Not very welcoming and very expensive but the food was great I must say.",
            "Good but way overpriced. If you like pretty good prices at very high prices then this is your place.",
            "Always interesting going here. The service is a bit odd, but the hot pot it's self is amazing and a lot of fun.",

            "Quite authentic Chinese hot pot.",
            "Excellent hot pot! You can customize it too!",
            "A popular space for Chinese food, but I don't like the fact that it is underground, which makes it feel a bit crowded and overheated.",
            "Hey! We ordered online today to pick up and the place is closed!!! What is this?! I hope you don\u2019t charge it....and if you do, return the money!",
            "It's terrible restaurant in the world. Everyone don't waste your money and try other Chinese restaurant in Ithaca. Terrible ,terrible  terrible!",

Garnishes (veggies, noodles, mushrooms) are a bit sparse but adequate for a small solo pot. They have a small sauce bar on the side for $2 as well.\n\nSichuanese here is always a hit. Highly recommend the Mapo Tofu or spicy fish stew. Large family style portions that are perfect for sharing. Would recommend the entrees here over the hot pot.\n\nPrices are reasonable given the portion sizes and quality. HEADS UP: There is a 15% service charge automatically included in the check.\n\nPerfect place for large family/friend outings and cold snowy days. Will definitely be coming back \ud83c\udf72\ud83e\uded5",

That should tell you all you need to know about this place, that she'd recognize me 10+ years after I left Ithaca.\n\nBest Indian food in upstate New York, period.",
            "Thanks.",
            "The food is excellent.  The staff is quite friendly.  There is a familial atmosphere and an authenticity to their dishes.  The place gets very busy during the holidays and one has to wait a little extra to be served, but that is to be expected in a crowded restaurant.  It is one of the best traditional Indian restaurant in Ithaca.",
            "Such great food! The chaye was amazing. Super friendly and accommodating people. The atmosphere is so nice to dine in. 10/10",
            "The people are very kind and great to talk to! The food is always quick and tastes delicious! It's clear alot of passion and tradition go into their cooking.",
            "Our favorite take out in Ithaca. I've never been in person but the food it great. Can be a little inconsistent but always delicious.",
            "Sangam Restaurant is so Amazing!! Best restaurant in Ithaca by miles. My friends wanted to try the Chicken Curry and I tried the Spicy Chicken Curry. As soon as they opened it, they could not help themselves and ate it immediately; saying it was the best Chicken they ever had. I kept taking Chicken Pieces out the container to eat because they were tender with lot of flavors and I was hungry. The yellow Basmati Rice is so incredible. They have Red Onion Relish from the beautiful giant yellow onions.  All of their dishes are amazing. If you go in Sangam Restaurant the atmosphere is so Serene.  The owners are so nice.  You will feel happy and peaceful enjoying your meal.",
            "Chicken Kabab was amazinggggg!! We also had lamb biryani and was good combination.",
            "The food tastes good. Dine in is recommended to get the right experience. Had some issues with the online order, Probably something wrong on the app end. Overall, food is very tasty and the people are kind enough to offer extras.",
            "We catered food from Sangam for a party in our home last week. We had butter chicken, palak paneer, mixed vegetable curry and Naan. The food was excellent and everyone enjoyed it thoroughly.  The owners were very friendly and helpful. We definitely plan to order from Sangam again in the future.\n\nKumari",
            "We drove 1 hour just to try and eat their food . We also waited 20 mins for them to open because in afternoon they are closed for few hours .\nAnyhow we order karahi paneer , bengan Bartha , naan , tandoori roti and Butter chicken.\n\nOmg I think \ud83e\udd14 been to many Indian Restaurants but never had any bad experience like here .\nBengan bharta is full of sweet peas and with gravy in it . We ask them to fix it and lady ( owner or chef ) came out and she told us that you have to told us before ordering that you don't want peas in it . Never heard this thing from any owner .\nDon't waste money",
            "Been going here since I was a child and have enjoyed then and now. Sangam is a great place with even better Indian food. The owners I have known since way back and they are very nice, friendly, and caring people. If you are looking for Indian food in Ithaca, Sangam is the place to go.",
            "The ambiance here leaves a lot to be desired but the food was excellent. For two, the bill with 2 glasses of wine was about $50 without tip. We were served food in paper and plastic to-go containers which was weird. Apparently, a large crowd preceded us so they were out of real dishes? The one waiter was friendly and excellent. The the place itself was tired in its appearance and not the cleanest. So, if you want great food and not worried about the feel of the place, this is a great option. Maybe carry out is the way to go!",
            "The food here was awsome and spicy when from on a scale of 1 to 5 i ordered a 5 and it eas just the right amount of spice. I eat very spicy foods so i was very pleased. Our waitress was alright she could have talked to us more... But id highly recommend this place it has decent prices also",
            "I ordered food for pick-up and when I got there they said the food wasn\u2019t made because they never got the order. Normally I would be fine with that, but the woman was very rude about it and acted like it was my fault the order didn\u2019t go through even though it has been confirmed and received by DoorDash. Their attitude makes it very clear they don\u2019t care about providing quality or friendly customer service.",
            "We absolutely love to eat here. Great food and service. Very authentic.",
            "The naan from the \"Bread Basket\" was soft and tasty.  Palak paneer was the best my wife had ever had.  The back of the menu had this cool map on it.  The restaurant has been there since the 1980s.  They survived the pandemic!",
            "NEVER AGAIN! Asked for one entree spicy other non spicy, both came SPICY!\nWoke up at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning puking my guts up and diarrhea nonstop for 3 days straight. There food is not sanitary and meat products are old. I thought I was going to die after eating from this place",
            "Excellent food and wonderful hosts.\n\nWe were traveling from Singapore and stopped over in Ithaca for a night. Wanted something indian so searched, landed at Sangam and glad we did.\n\nWe ordered daal makhani, kadai paneer, naans, rotis and rice. Everything was very well cooked and had an authentic Indian flavour and taste. Special mention for daal makhani, which tasted authentic, with typical punjabi taste, as it should be and not many places can boost of that, but Sangam did a fantastic job. I would recommend it anyday. And don't miss to see their collection of currency notes",
            "Terrible place! DO NOT VISIT ! EXTREMELY RUDE LADY! We went here as a family of 5 for dinner. Had a horrifying experience. Felt like they were doing us a favor while we were dining. Utencils are not clean at all, you might fall sick as I saw leftovers on the spoons. And they added a 15% tip by default, ridiculous! What on earth did i tip for?! Please watch out. I do not recommend dining here.\nI'd rather skip a meal than dine here. The last thing anyone wants is to be disrespected when they dine.",
            "Ordered on Grubhub, and after food arriving extremely late and cold, called and texted repeatedly demanding reasoning, and then refused to serve again.   Retaliating for using Grubhub\u2019s guarantee and saving and calling/texting your personal line is kind of scary.",
            "Amazing service, the owners are very hospitable. The food quality is perhaps the best I have had in a very long time. The prices are really good and justifiable for the portion size. I highly recommend trying this restaurant.",
            "Worst experience and not worth the money. Firstly, it says 10pm at Google maps and we went about 9.15pm. The owner guy said they'll be closed at 9.30pm but didn't refused to dine in. Then, We ordered food and thought it's all halal, as some of the comments says so. Waited for about and hour and suddenly came to know that, only goat and lamb dishes are halal, chicken is not! The meat option then changed, because they haven't start preparing. Only for this, we considered to dine, or else all of us were starving! But the food came at last and it was chicken \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f turns out he had not informed the kitchen properly. Waited for another 30 mins.\n\nSecondly, the portion size was relatively small and each dish comes with one plate of rice as they say. We ordered 5 currys and it served only one plate of rice hardly enough for 2. The guy claimed they serves all portion in one plate. We asked the another service woman and she confessed that there's a shortage. Then why lying in the first place!\n\nIf you cannot offer service, simply accept it. They never apologised for the inconvenience and in a constant argument with one another. I'll never recommend anyone ever to dine in or order at this horrible place!",

            "Literally they made us wait for 2 hours. Only 2 people were managing the entire service. After patiently waited for such long time, we finally got the food but still the taste is horrible and not recommended. Overall, we are left with a bad food and service which is highly unexpected.",
            "Order delivery, I waited so long I forgot I ordered it. Took them 3 hours to get me my food, the food wasn\u2019t bad, but it wasn\u2019t good! I will absolutely never get food from here again.",
            "We ordered -\nKadhai Paneer - not good at all, paneer pieces were hard, gravy wasn\u2019t good either. It felt like they made gravy with whatever was left. It wasn\u2019t kadhai paneer gravy. Quantity was less ( which I am glad for as I hate wasting food and this wasn\u2019t good at all)\nAalloo paratha - Not great not bad, if you are trying aalloo paratha for the first time I wouldn\u2019t recommend trying here\nGarlic Naan - good\n\nThe service is okayish.",

On asking, the waitress agreed to bring us plates but first have the plates to every customer waiting for food and we patiently waited for plates while our food was getting cold. Had to ask for spoons, water, everything. Seating is tight. Food was okay, nothing exceptional. If we knew it would take them so much time to serve, we would gone elsewhere.",
            "I love the restaurant but this is actually a review for the lunch takeout at Center Ithaca. It's the first place I ever had a samosa (25 years ago) and they're still there going strong! Perfect place to go in the afternoon If you just want a quick Indian fix! The portions are generous and the gentleman working there was so, so friendly! The samosas are still just as good! Go for a quick lunch here during the day or visit the restaurant in college town for the full experience. :)",
            "In five years of living in the Ithaca area, I can confidently state that the best food is made and served by the hardest working, underrated, and often overlooked restaurants. Sangam Restaurant is one of the local dining establishments that makes delicious, flavorful food, that is unpretentious, traditional, and extremely affordable. Chef Beni's kitchen uses exotic spices appropriately, all dishes are made naturally, from scratch, and the ingredients are of the highest quality, and the sauce driven menu is truly gourmet. Some of the best sauces and tandoori style dishes that I have tasted. I urge you to try their in-house made breads, straight from the clay oven. The vegetarian choices are numerous, and meat dishes run the gamut from fish, chicken, beef, lamb, and goat. A truly authentic, cultural experience can be found here. Excellent service in a no-frills setting, where Indian cuisine is made accessable, affordable, and food quality is at the forefront!",
            "Enjoyed this little Indian restaurant excellent Lamb Korai and naan. They are doing a roaring trade with takeouts very friendly.",
            "Thank you for the free dessert! (Rice pudding) I like their Kashmiri naan and masala dosa.",
            "Hands down the best Indian food in town! Excellent food and great customer service! My personal favorite is their chicken curry with naan bread. Would definitely recommend the mango lassi as well!",
            "Food was pretty good. Not the best nor the worst biriyani I\u2019ve had. Service, though, was horrible. Only two people working the floor during lunch rush. Waited for around 40 min for us to get our check and pay.",
            "The chole bhature and the aloo tikki chaat are a must - truly delicious",
            "This place is very dull. Food taste is not good and it takes around 40 minutes to serve food after order. They will add 15% tips with your bill if you have more than 5 persons group. Not recommended for Indian food. Amount of the food is very small for a person.",
            "It was our wedding anniversary and we got some food. The food was delicious and they gave us a complimentary rice pudding. It was very sweet.",
            "\u2022  Sangam Indian Cuisine ranks among  the top  restaurants in ithaca.  the go-to for me.\n\u2022  i don\u2019t know the chefs (thanks COVID), and i don\u2019t cook the food, but i feel satisfied, even proud, after each regale - because i made such a good choice.\n\u2022  each meal has been delicious, start to finish. from samosas to vindaloo; tikka masala to rasmalai. eating that dessert makes me feel  like a spicy little miss muffet! even the rice is so nice. it is consistently perfect.\n\u2022 my favorite dish is lamb sagwala. i could eat it every day. the lamb is always cooked just right, and the spices are amazing.\n\u2022  the portions are generous. leftovers make one to three meals more for me. but, one friend cleans his plate every time after promising he won\u2019t. disappointing. no leftovers for me.\n\u2022 i always order several extra servings of the house-made dahi, so i can have it at home for the next few days, or share it with friends. my efforts to convince supposed yogurt-lovers, haven\u2019t failed yet: \u201cyogurt from the grocery store? well, i don\u2019t know what we have been eating all these years, but taste this!\u201d impresses every time.\n\u2022 i crave the sagwala sometimes.  okay, often. other times, if we\u2019re just indecisive, we settle on Sangam, because we know we\u2019ll be happy.\n\u2022  i don't typically write reviews. but i am appreciative that this food helped sustain us through COVID. visitors, newcomers, and locals alike, be sure you don't skip this gem.",
            "Amazing food! Highly recommend!!\n\nWe made a pitstop on a road trip and were looking for some Indian food. The flavors were so authentic and we enjoyed every bite. The spice levels were to our liking. The lady who answered the phone was very polite and took our orders. Even my toddler enjoyed the food. Typically when you order multiple items some taste better than the others! But at Sangam everything was great!",
            "We went for the lunch buffet.  It consisted of typical Indian dishes like chicken curry, butter chicken, nan, rice, chickpea curry, and others.  The lunch buffet is $10.50 which is a reasonable price.",
            "Good Indian food, especially for the area. Malai Kofta here is great, and anything with paneer in it is always tasty. I got the mild this last time, and it literally wasn't spicy at all; I'll have to try medium next time. Highly recommend if you're craving Indian food while in the Ithaca area.",
            "Average food. All dishes does not tastes the actual indian way. For example. I did not expect broccoli and bell pepper in chicken briyani. But it was good like a rice mixed in chicken gravy.\nOverall its good for that location.",
            "We love Sangam! Always good food, never had a bad experience! They get very busy at dinner time so make sure to order a little earlier than you think, but always worth the wait!",
            "Let us place a huge order at 9:55pm, 5 minutes before they close. Food was terrific and they were super friendly.",
            "The food is phenomenal. Best Indian food I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019ve tried quite a few dishes and they are all fantastic. They\u2019re really nice there too. So pleasant. Just all around good.",
            "I've eaten here many times over the years and have always been very impressed with how delicious the food is. For the last two years, I've had Sangam takeout for my birthday. The large takeout orders have been thoughtfully packaged, the orders are correct, and I've been very happy",
            "One of the worst service and the food quality is disgusting. Had order some naan and naan was like rubber it looked like the naan was wormed up in the microwave. If you have lot of money and you don\u2019t know where to spend then you should go there.",
            "Very tasty food! Garlic Naan was fabulous! Great overall experience!",
            "Mediocre food and service. First dine in restaurant I was served with disposable dishes & utensils. Food was actually served in disposable containers! Tandoori mixed was not served hot. Korma lamb and Samosas Chat were best items ordered. Recommend doing your research and choosing another establishment.",
            "I was pleasantly surprised to find such good Indian food in Ithaca. I have eaten at more than 100+ different Indian restaurants in the states. This is very authentic. My family loved the chana saag, alu matar, dal tadka, aloo paratha, sweet lassi, chai. everything was outstanding and freshly made. Always check if the cook is Indian. I was able to talk to the cook and the manager. Both were very cordial and pleasing to have conversation with. Running a food business is very difficult. This family owned business is 30 years old which is phenomenal. I saw one or two negative reviews so was hesitant at first to go here but after eating there, I would say, I can eat here everyday. All I would suggest to other customers like me is to be patient so that you get good freshly made food and do not be short tempered as running an Indian restaurant business is super difficult.",
            "Everything was fresh and delicious. Customer service was very friendly. if you craving some Indian food it's a must visit!",
            "I coordinated an event with 25+ people and they were super organized and the food was delicious!\nBenny and Nav thank you. There was another gentleman who was super helpful but I forgot his name. Either way, great service and great food at such a short notice!",
            "Not only is their food amazing, but the couple that runs this restaurant are pretty hospitable too. During peak covid, they still managed to adapt and prepare amazing food on time. I love their naan (its hard to find that kind of naan even in old delhi these days). Their chole, dal, malai kofta and kheer is also too good. I wish them all the best!",
            "My wife and I lived more than 25 years in Ithaca and regularly had dinner or take-out from Sangam in college town. The food was always excellent and prepared with great care. I personally enjoyed their Dal Makani very much. The staff and owners were always very friendly. It was an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend you try it out.",
            "We ordered catering from Sangam and the food was delicious, well prepared, and delivered on time. The portions were substantial and we and our guests enjoyed the food thoroughly.",
            "Not friendly to service dogs. If you are disabled, handicapped or have a service dog, I'd recommend going elsewhere.\n\nWe decided to try there for lunch. The two of us went in about noon on a Sunday, and my date brought her service dog, a 10 pound King Charles Spaniel. Upon entering, the owner said no dogs allowed. We explained it was a service dog. The owner asked us to keep the dog on the inside of the table. We agreed. He then repeated his request. After being seated and complying with his request, keeping the dog on the inside of the table, he decided to repeat himself again. At this point we both decided to leave and went elsewhere, and won't bother to go back. The owner went out of his way to harass and nag us, so not worth my business.",
            "the food is good for ithaca HOWEVER, be aware that your food will take an hour over the \"ready time\" and they typically do not even make your food until you call in to check on it. they are VERY RUDE and often leave items off so make SURE you check your food first. They charge you for items and they don't give you everything you ordered. Its always a bad experience and I only ordered food because my favorite is closed for the holiday.",
            "The best Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi close to home cusine. This restaurant served top quality HALAL FOOD. Goat rogen Josh and lamb biriyani is the best test there and other food is also. I recomend all Muslim community as well as others to try this restaurant.",
            "Excellent food ! No frills paper plates, etc.. but it's where people come for authentic eats. The smells from the kitchen brought me in from down the block. Love it!",
            "I've lived in Ithaca for the past 5 years and have been going to Sangam at least once a month. It is perhaps one of the best places I've eaten at in my life \u2014 a restaurant that truly practices cuisine in a fresh and generous way.\nI especially recommend the dal makhani, dal tadka, matar paneer, and kadhi pakora. On the bread side, have the methi parantha, the lacha parantha, and the chapati.",
            "Food taste was pretty bad. Chicken Biryani was prepared with broccoli and Tea/Mango lassi with water.",
            "Decent food, very poor service. Did not send us all items that were ordered for delivery. Said on the phone that they would give a full refund, but then when we accepted, another person stated that they would only give us a refund for only the left out item and 10% off on next order, as if we're coming back LOL. Very disappointing experience. Also, they tried blaming it on the fact that they have new staff, which is their issue not the customers'",
            "Disappointing, not worth the money. Spent nearly 20$ on an order of chicken biriyani and a side of dahi. The rice had a funky metallic taste to it. On top of that, the nuts used in the dish were so soggy and gross looking, it was like someone had soaked their calluses and cut them off to sprinkle them in the food. The dahi had a strange chemical-y taste as well..I ended up just eating the chicken pieces and throwing away the rest because it was too yucky. This was my first time ordering from Sangam and I am sad that it was a bad experience. I have had much better biriyani from other Indian restaurants for less money. Probably will not order here again \ud83d\ude2a",
            "Have eaten here twice, one indoor seating pre-covid, and one takeout pretty recently. The indoor seating experience was amazing, the owner was super attentive and funny, making sure we were comfy and got exactly what we ordered at the right spice levels. The food was delicious, I had never had Indian Cuisine before this and man was I missing out! I got butter chicken and the sauce was incredible! Naan & basmati rice was all incredible as well! Thank you for introducing me to an incredible culture and incredible food!\n\nNot really any parking onstreet, but thats the name of the game in Ithaca.",
            "I've been getting takeout from Sangam at least a couple of times a month, for several months now. It has been consistently delicious. I've tried several different entrees, and have loved all of them. I ordered three meals for myself for my solitary Thanksgiving. Yum!",
            "Thank you for your trust in to our Business and look forward to serve you again.",
            "Definitely my go-to Indian Restaurant! The staff are so friendly every time I come in and the food is amazing :) It is without a doubt one of my favorite places to eat in Ithaca --- highly recommend it to others in the area!",
            "Pretty good! Not a whole lot of choices, but very tasty and fresh. Good prices, relaxing, great service.",
            "I took vegetable mango and mango kulfi. Food was excellent and dessert as well. Presentation of food fits the collage town to which I'm not used to but the overall food experience sounds positive.",
            "The food here tastes great, and is authentic. The manager is very kind and attentive to all the customers. I love going to the Lunch special buffet from 12-3PM every day for 9 dollars.\nYou won't regret it! Their curry is amazing.",
            "This place is great !! Not only is the food delicious -- me and my roommates eat there all the time -- but the people are sweet. Great deal on the lunch buffet and honestly everything is very affordable. Most importantly, the food is so good I could eat there every day.",
            "Me and my family have been going here for years. Wonderful food, wonderful people.  They are dedicated to providing good food and service.  sangam has such a broad menu, too.  We love their masaladosa, naan, such good rice and, as vegetarians, there\u2019s a lot to choose.",
            "Bad service, good food, very expensive.",
            "This can really be the worst experience in my life. I paid 16 bucks for 7 little raw prawns with raw onions, and a box of rice. Raw shrimps\uff01 Disgusting and ridiculous. is that the way they treat customers??? feel so angry and won\u2019t come back again. the service is extremely slow and the food is very bad. I don\u2019t have any appetite for the food I ordered, though I am very hungry, and I am still starving. Can you imagine the feeling of cannot wait to post a comment on google without finishing your food???",
            "Please avoid this place. I ordered curry goat and samosas and woke up sick the  next day. As I write at night, I'm still nauseous and my stomach is still upset. When I picked up my food, I thought the food didn't look fresh, like food that had been reheated several days over. It didn't taste as flavorful and aromatic as Indian food usually is - I am a huge fan of Indian food, so I should know. Anyway, I don't know what kind of crap they served me, but for $20 for a half-eaten dish, it surely wasn't worth it. Maybe others have had a better experience, but I\"m just sharing mine. I hope the owners see this and take extra sanitary precautions.",
            "They seated us quickly at a dirty table. There were gross stains on the tablecloth and a dirty napkin on the floor under my chair. We ordered food, and it took 1 hour and 20 minutes to arrive. An hour in we spoke to the manager and waitress, but that didn't seem to help much, eventually he offered a meager 10 percent off. We had ordered an appetizer and they completely forgot to bring it as well, so we had to ask after our main course arrived.\n\nThe food was bad. We got a chicken vindaloo that was \"hot\" yet it was bland and lacked flavor. My acquaintance couldn't finish her butter chicken because it was so bland as well. The rice had no seasoning. The papadums tasted burned and had no redeeming qualities.\n\nIt's clear the owner just cares about his bottom line, as the place is understaffed, the seating is too crunched, the whole place is dirty, and the food has little seasoning.\n\nSave yourself the hassle, eat at Mehak instead, it's probably 3 times better in taste, service, cleanliness, and experience.",
            "Best Indian food in Collegetown. Can\u2019t go wrong with Sangam. Food is always fresh, well made, and tastes great!",
            "Fantastic Indian restaurant in Ithaca with arguably the best value-for-money lunch buffet in the area. I usually go for the Butter Chicken or the Curry Chicken, which are also my two favorite dishes served here at this restaurant. While their prices have been going up a bit lately, I still recommend this restaurant highly.",
            "The food was great and the portions were generous. The only issue I had was with the non-veg assorted platter. The list looked great but the platter was scanty and dry. I will recommend getting a regular meal instead of appetizers.",
            "Love this place \u2014 the food is amazing! I\u2019ve been getting take out once a week from Sangam for a few months now because it\u2019s that good. The staff and owners have always been so flexible and kind when I\u2019ve had to place in person or pick up orders for large groups and events.10/10 would recommend if you haven\u2019t been already!",
            "I deliver mail in the area and make a point to devour the lunch buffet often. I always leave full, satisfied and fueled up for the many miles I walk. The staff is incredibly kind to me every time and the food is delicious. Great variety and always fresh!",
            "Thanks from Sangam staff. Happy New Year.",
            "The food here is always excellent. This is one of the few restaurants in Ithaca that I actually get excited to eat at. I can tell they take so much pride in their food and it shows. The spices/ingredients are always perfect. Out of all the Indian restaurants I've eaten at this one is most definitely the tastiest.\n\nDon't bother with the popular restaurant chains in the area that are content with simply throwing food together, not caring how it comes out. There are much better options here, and this is one of them.",
            "Good food - we ordered the butter chicken, dal tadka and aloo Gobi with the bread platter. Spice level was just right as well. The papri chat was tangy (came pre-mixed) and went along really well with the chai. Definitely a must try place if you are craving Indian food. I\u2019ll be back :)",
            "Delicious authentic Indian food.  Best prepared food we've had in Ithaca.  I at at this place over 20 years ago and they've been around this long for a reason.  My only slight complaint - please have grubhub orders ready at the specified time.",
            "Ordered tandoori chicken, horrible preparation, served chicken which was stale and cold. Owner advised he overcooked one piece when really it seemed like it was a day old and not fresh at all.  Requested a refund, owner by the name Benny advised to meet the following day, upon showing up the restaurant is non operational on mondays.  Wish he advised us before making the trip again go get a refund.  Never again.",
            "Chicken biriyani was good but rice tasted a bit dry. Didn't ask if we needed silverware or napkins to go, which would have been nice. Perfect spice level.",
            "I ordered Chicken Biryani, Garlic Naan, and Chicken Sagwala. All three were delicious and I would recommend them to anyone who is thinking about eating at Sangam Restaurant. Looking forward to the next time I dine with them!",
            "Ordered for the first time last night for delivery. The food, goat vindaloo, Goa fish curry, and baingan bharta, was all excellent. It arrived very hot and right on time. This will be our go-to Indian in Ithaca from now on!",
            "Really nice guy and good food. Will come back!!",
            "We value your comments and look forward seeing you again. Thanks.",
            "Best place ever to eat, their food is great, their staff are really friendly. Their music is Awesome! Prices are very reasonable and Lots of choices. I\u2019m a very picky eater but I found plenty to eat here. Fianc\u00e9 has an endless stomach so we always spend a small fortune going out to eat. We were able to get a little of everything and still come out below what we normally spend! Definetly a great overall place. Never have we had a bad experience here. :)",
            "First time trying while visiting my IC student. Best naan I have had in a long time. Chicken vindaloo was flavorful, spicy, tender .... perfect. Nice to see something a little different going on with the rice to make it a little more memorable. Glad I ordered extra.  Need to try dosas when I am back in the fall. If they nail these then they are 5+ stars.  Give them I try and you will see what I mean.",
            "In terms of authenticity and flavor, the two other Indian restaurants in the area can't compare. We hit up Sngam's almost every Sunday for the buffet. Recently, we figured we would just try the other Indian places in the area again to mix it up, and sure enough, they were disappointing and overly Americanized. We'll never \"cheat\" on Sangam again! Sangam is our sure favorite. Sangam offers a range of spices, so our three small children under age six all find plenty to eat, yet my husband and I who love really spicy food also leave more than content. The staff is accommodating and is always sure to engage our children in a friendly manner. I grew up eating authentic Indian cuisine, and I'm glad Ithaca offers the real deal at Sangam.",
            "The best Indian food in Ithaca!!!  This place is great with a nice homely dining room attended by friendly servers.  The food is crazy good and authentic cooks been cooking a long time and know what they are doing!",
            "I eat at Sangam frequently because the food is so amazing. Owners and staff very friendly as well. Best Indian buffet I have ever found! Try it! You won't regret it!",
            "Food was decent. Only people in the restaurant but still sat there an hour. Had several take outs, but not enough to justify time.\n\nOnly gave a 4 cause of the entertainment we had when we arrived. Ithaca cops escorted what seemed to be a worker out. Haha",
            "Had a very bad experience at Sangam. First they split water over baby and myself. The order took almost an hour to arrive and main course was served before appetizers. Seems like they lack basic skills and very poor customer service. Never going back.",
            "If you're looking to be ripped off, this is your place. I ordered the \"coconut soup\"\u2014it was literally coconut milk. I ordered the tandori mix\u2014there was a single piece of shrimp. I ordered some curry\u2014only a couple pieces of chicken. Why are you cheating your customers?",
            "Delicious, hygienic and more than enough quantity Indian food was delivered on my daughters birthday celebration.\n\nWe like to thank Sangham Ithaca Indian Hotel Captain, Staff and Owner for exceptional service !",
            "We had great an experience at this restaurant ,food was delicious , served  hot and fresh .I m so glad to give five star",
            "Their food is, simply put, incredible. I do my best to visit as many different Indian food restaurants and I ALWAYS come back to this one. I can't tell if it's their Aloo Palak or their vegetable korma but there's something special in their food (Experience? Skill? Love?). Either way I have yet to try a dish from them that I don't like.",
            "Sangam buffet has been a consistently delicious lunch option for many years.  They are my go-to comfort food.  It\u2019s very affordable and the staff and owners are always friendly and helpful.",
            "Always delicious food. Hopefully the lunch buffet and dinning in will be able to come back again someday. It's exciting to try all the different dishes. Perhaps they could do a special sampler plate.",
            "This restaurant is so amazing, food is delicious and reasonable price. Plz don\u2019t miss . I love to every-time. They are so nice and you will receive warm welcoming.",
            "It's a nice authentic Indian restaurant in terms of spice level. I was not able to give full Five star as some of the dishes were not to my liking. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend and is value for money.",
            "Sangam has average Indian food that will satisfy you only if you don't know what Indian food really is. The spices are misused and out of place. I mean, who puts broccoli in a Biriyani? As some one who went there feeling homesick, I left resolved to cook more myself. Also, the waiters were kind of rude. Go if you crave something Indian and you can't cook it yourself.",
            "They have limited service while dining in and will get annoyed when you order food second time or ask for cutlery.\nFood was okay, but would recommend going to different place if dining in.",
            "Very good food at reasonable prices.  We especially liked the taste differentiation among various dishes.  Also, open late (10 pm) and 7 days:  always a bit of a worry in an unfamiliar city.",
            "Their tandoori chicken is the best I've ever had. The naan, curries, rice, kheer, and gajar halwa is all really good too. The restaurant is often practically empty, which usually worries me, but the food is so good--especially at lunch buffet time, not dinner.",
            "It was our first time getting food from here. We visited from Long Island to Watkins and it was hard to find Desi food. Then I found this place here , Delicious food , great customer service. Will be visiting there tomorrow for our Desi breakfast",
            "In terms of food, this place is above average. They have masala dosa with the buffet. The service is poor. We had to keep asking them for water refills, tell them to clear the old plates. Also they didnt refill nan and dosa until we asked them for it. The waitress was new, probably it might be because of inexperience. Anyways, they can do better. I would prefer mehak if given a choice.",
            "Worst Indian food restaurant I have ever come across. People who like true indian food would never like this place. I ordered masala dosa, so the waitress just got the masala dosa and when asked about Sambhar and chutney, her reply was that you have to order that separately,  and the cost for that separare order is 13.94. I am glad that I didnt waste my money on that separate order coz the masala tasted like masala of aloo parantha stuffed in that salty crepe. My husband ordered tandoori chicken and it was undercooked, coz we could see red colour meat. The best thing in the menu was cold plain water, that's it, Period. Hope this review help people to not waste their money.",
            "Love Sangam! The food is always excellent and the buffet always has a nice variety. The staff is very friendly. I go here weekly and no other Indian food place has food this good!",
            "Food can be a little too oily unless you ask otherwise. For some reason they don't have a white rice option and any rice that comes as a side with an entr\u00e9e item is fried in oil. The bread is good, but again, a bit loaded on the oil or butter.",
            "Very blend curries as if no masalas.\nQuantity for each Indian dish very less .",
            "Ate here every weekend, and many weekdays, from 2010-14. It was like home -- I must have eaten there more than 200 times.\n\nAs such, they gave me customisable menus, single portions, and home-like customer service.",
            "I always love Indian food and can go anywhere to eat it but this place really had a worst worst worst food ever. After eating the Indian food of this place, it made me quit  it. Plus the waiting time is like hell. It\u2019s like a dead person can take rebirth in that duration.I  will never refer anyone to go at this place. Instead, go and grab some pizza.",
            "Their food is ok, but not worth the deplorable costumer service. When they get orders wrong they demand that you pay for the food twice just to get the order right. I have patronized this establishment for years but will no longer because of the horrible way they treat customers who have issues with their order. Their food is not worth the hassle",

            "the goan fish curry is delicious and a relatively unique item. sometimes during the lunch buffet, they have kadai chicken and gulab jamun, which taste better here than at most other indian restaurants I have been to. I wish they had a better selection of south-indian dishes.",

The the driver lied to the restaurant, indicating the food had been delivered.   In other words, he attempted to cheat me.  Look somewhere else, especially when getting delivery.",

            "Those who have experienced pre-renovation Appel may join me in commiserating the loss of a quaint and comfortable dining facility. While the food has remained almost entirely the same, the experience of dining at Appel (North Star) is now drastically different, and far less appealing.\n\nAppel was essential to my freshman year at Cornell. I would be up bright and early to have my morning omelette (still available) and watch the sun rise in the quiet leisure of the dining area. Even during my most challenging moments in the semester, in which I would drag myself to Appel in my pajamas, I still felt like I had a comfortable place to start my day and still feel like I was home.\n\nNow, the bright white lights, walls, and floors make the location less inviting. I no longer feel like I could be comfortable at Appel in my pajamas, which, while silly, I consider to be an important point to note when creating a space for students to engage with and feel at home in. And while yes, they have added some new amenities such as their \"Bowl\" station (think Chipotle with less), they have also drastically expanded the seating options (cramming the place to the brim) and completely removed the allergen-safe preparation area.\n\nI used to vehemently defend Appel as the best dining hall. The staff were kind, the food was good, and the place felt like home. The staff are still kind, and the food is still good, but the place no longer feels like home to me.",
            "Dining here felt like I was a farm animal. They would \"dump\" food into the bins and us animals would scurry over and fight each other until the bin was empty, then wandered away and lurked for the next feeding.  Also, the food is so salty, I felt like I licked a block of salt for an hour.  Come on Cornell, you can do better for our kids.",
            "North Star (April) is my second favorite dining hall on North campus. I am gluten free and for me there are SO many more options than RPCC. Also, the choices here change more often than RPCC. Plus, it\u2019s the only dining hall on North campus that is open for breakfast. I would especially recommend this dining hall for perspective students visiting the campus because it is really close to the Martin Yang Welcome Center. RPCC vos. Appel is strongly debated but my vote goes to North Star!",
            "The price is reasonable while the food is high quality",
            "The food here is usually pretty good. I've only ever eaten here during the pandemic, so everything's socially distanced and all that. The tofu is never very good, so if you're a vegetarian that's pretty unfortunate, but the pork? Always amazing, whatever dish they serve. The people are friendly enough (it seems like everyone is here in Ithaca), and the service is good. Solid four stars.",
            "This is for their dining hall. Great variety of good food. They alternate the menu at a good frequency as well. One of my favorite things to do is fill a bowl with Cornell Dairy yogurt and granola that they always have and mix it all together.",
            "Yummy gurmet foods for affordable prices! Very flavorful not because of sauce or seasoning but  the freshness of the ingredients bring out the natural flavor. Don't get me wrong. The seasoning is light and perfect!",
            "Above average, and that is how it will feel. Eating there 2- 3 times a day will make you feel like you have very little options, and there is lots of repetition. However, they do a good enough job on the actual food, but it isn't DELICIOUS like you might get at a smaller, high quality restaurant",
            "I just adore the Sunday brunch. There is so much variety and it is very tasteful. The made to order omelettes, the egg benedict, the asian dimsum platter, the pizzas, the meat chops, it is just wonderful. A dinner I had there was also very good.",
            "Good north campus dining hall.  Always has fries, Asian food, pizza, homestyle food, a halal station, salad, cereal and desserts.  Personally, I prefer RPME, but North Star is good and worth trying.",
            "When it comes to dining on Cornell's North campus, you can't go wrong with Appel's dining hall. There is an insane variety of options and it's very easy to eat there with dietary restrictions (they have an allergen free zone and a kosher area!)",
            "Decent all you care to eat dining option on the Cornell campus. Of these on campus, this one probably has the most selection. Check the menu out each day to see what the special is.",
            "Vegan options are better than rpcc, but the overall quality usually goes down when you have to cook for thousands of people everyday.",

            "Excellent place to eat food. They have a huge variety of foods. I actually like them better than the dining halls because the salad bar has more options and is more organized. They also pay by the lb for a lot of stuff, so you don't have to feel compelled to stuff yourself to get your money's worth. On the go snacks are available too.",
            "Pretty good selection of food, from burgers to Chinese takeaway to burritos to ramen to pasta. The quality is decent, but prices run a tad high. Overall, a convenient stop for lunch when it's not too crowded.",
            "Great place to eat on campus. Many options for many people. Like any other restaurant, the wait time for food will depend on the time of day. Lunch time is usually full and it's empty towards closing. There are many tables and the staff is constantly cleaning. The prices are a little on the higher side, but  that's to be expected for a college  restaurant. On a side note: personally, I  recommend the burrito wraps.",
            "It's very overpriced for cafeteria food.\n\nEdit: After six months of trying everything they serve, the burger and the breakfast burrito are the only  good options. Everything else is the worst version of that thing I've ever had. The worst ramen I've ever had, the worst taco I've ever had, the worst fried chicken I've ever had, the worst pizza I've ever had, etc. If you go, just stick to the burger or the breakfast burrito. If you want fries, ask them to make you some fresh ones. The fries under the heat lamp are not worth having, but the fresh ones are yummy.\n\nThe staff there is very friendly and helpful.",
            "I want to throw up thinking about eating here. They have one or two decent options, but mainly the food can be flavorless, take too long, or be over or undercooked (still safe though), this applies to things like vegetables and pasta, not so much meats, which will be overcooked not undercooked. I do I have to say this location is great, but for the number of people that eat here it needs to be drastically improved.",
            "Lots of great options. A great place to blow big red bucks if you have them, otherwise a little pricey. The food and options are just so good though.\nWarning freshman/newcomers: if you're schedule is right, you will find that halfway through the semester you have gained 15 pounds and all your big red bucks are gone. Consider this your millionth, and not last warning.",
            "I enjoy going to Trillium; compared to other dining options on-campus or in collegetown I think it strikes a fair bargain. The burger, quesadilla, and burrito bowl are my favs but the other food there is decent as well. The bbq pork is always good.",
            "One of the best places to spend your BRBs. Plenty of food option from burritos and omelettes in the morning to burgers, salads and ramen for lunch. Staff are friendly and there are plenty of space to sit. Space upstairs are more quiet and you can go through to Kennedy hall from upstairs.",
            "Good variety of foods for the college crowd- gets very busy during the \"in-between\" class time points, so plan out your trip to get food or you will spend your entire lunchtime standing in line for a burger..",
            "Although there are many options, I wouldn't want to come back here. I've been here twice. The Chinese stall's food was decent. I like that it's delicious but not too oily. The portion is also large. I could easily kept half of it for another meal. However, the chicken ramen that I have just eaten ($9.49) was terrible. Undoubtedly the lowest quality ramen I have ever eaten in my life. My palate for ramen is probably higher than many people here, simply because I had eaten many good ramens in Japan and had cooked some of them by myself. But the taste here is just so sad. There is no dimension to the dish at all. The chicken broth is so bland - and mild as if it has been diluted with the ratio of 1:5 of stock to water. The onsen egg is overcooked. The noodles' quality is the same as that of the cheapest type you can find in grocery store. This noodle might not go so bad with a heavily sauced yakisoba. But with such a boring soup, it has no taste. The chicken isn't too bad. But the texture is so dense that it's difficult to eat. The spring onion is sliced too thick. The Napa cabbage and carrots are so tasteless it shouldn't even be here. The most acceptable thing of this bowl is the canned corns. It doesn't taste much. But at least it doesn't disappoint me.\n\nBtw, I understand that this is cafeteria good and that it's unfair to judge it the same way I usually do with those in ramen restaurants. But you can read this as an honest reaction of someone who came here as a customer. The food filled my stomach but left me feeling empty and hungrier than before I entered this dining hall. The lack of care in this bowl strongly reminded me why I want to cook tonight.",
            "I have no complaints about the food, the pricing is slightly high but decent for the most part. However, the customer service is terrible. I get ridiculous amounts of attitude from \"Miss Libby\" the inadequate cashier every time I go and it absolutely ruins my experience. This is just unacceptable, I am a paying customer and I deserve to be treated like one.",
            "Ok food. Wok Station: The sesame chicken was hard and the lo mein was too cut up and oily. $7 for a small portion? Pass\nQuesadilla Station: I tried the chicken quesadilla. It was fine. Dissapointed in the portion size. Again, not worth the high price\nRamen Station: I think this is one of the better places.",

            "Trillium is very good when it comes to college food service. There is a plethora of options, from make your own salads to a customizable pasta bar. Soups, chicken fingers, fries, burgers, quesadillas, pizza, hot wraps, and Chinese. One of the best General Tso I've ever had anywhere! Lots of seating downstairs with a second level as well.

I do not frequent this place often, however I decided to go for a lunch break with some colleagues, and the cashier had an attitude with me about the order in which I paid for my food. She then came over to our table on her lunch break to yell at one of my colleagues to move her chair over. She wasn\u2019t even on the clock anymore! THEN the manager came over and accused us of drinking alcohol and said that we loudly stated \u201cWe are drinking alcohol at the barn\u201d so she was forced to intervene, which is just not a real thing someone would say normally. Why would anyone proclaim that to an entire restaurant? They literally sell beer here anyway so drinking alcohol isn\u2019t even an issue! And just so we\u2019re clear, we were not doing anything out of the ordinary to get this kind of treatment. We were trying to enjoy our lunch and got rudely interrupted not once but twice.

            "I only come for salsa so cannot comment on much else. By itself, it is a very nice building deity a lot of character. Multi level with loft walkway around the main dance floor. The biggest problem is that for salsa, it is too small as the dance floor use a very small portion of the actual barn. Plus, they always put the live band at the same floor, taking maybe 1/3 off. And they store tables and chairs on the same area, reducing the dancing area even more. And it's always crowded as it is on Cornell campus. Mostly newcomers so the dancing is not spectacular.",

This is my first time here and I found the quality of both and desserts really impressive. The choice is limited, but they are tasty and pretty healthy. The arugula salad with pickled red onions and cheery tomatoes was sooo good in its own that I didn't even need salad dressing. Sourdough bread was a farmer-market-level high quality one. The whipping cream feels like it's made of real milk and the chocolate cake didn't feel too sugary. They seem to be attentive at providing vegan food (and desserts). But I didn't see much variety eg. no Kosher/Halal/Asian/Middle Eastern food. (But so far I have only been there once so I don't know how the selection will be in other days!)\n\nPs. There was a tiny stage in this dining hall. There was a drum performance on the day I visited it. That's interesting! It's great if you like this sort of thing. But no so good if you prefer quietness during meal time.",
            "Generally speaking, I am a fan of Cook house dining. It's the only West campus dining hall open until 9 pm, which I greatly appreciate. Best days of the week to be here for dinner are Monday (for Mexican) and Thursday (for Chinese).",
            "Last Friday\u2019s menu said they will have ice cream but we found none :( The desi foods and others tasted amazing except the Madrasi chicken that kinda felt chewy and there were spicy tofu bites. They were so sweet, the first bite was a burst of flavors and felt so amazing. But having multiple sweet bites wasn\u2019t a good idea at least for me. Kinda diminished the appeal of the flavor! Liked their egg salad and fish salad a lot.",

            "\ud83d\udea8 Yummy Alert! \ud83d\udea8\nThe crab and corn soup is soooooo tasty! Try it.\nLayout of the food area is a bit odd which creates a bad logistical flow for people getting food and those exiting with their food. Also, the staff are seemingly unfriendly and I swear I thought the guy serving in the hot food section was going to drip sweat into the curry. The older lady next to him served the rice so sloppy. The dish looked ugly because of how it was served and presented and so I left it. But, the crab and corn soup is fantastic!",

I go AT LEAST 3 days a week, only for Lo and Justin",

I believe if I was asked to put together a dish like a phoritto, for a price($8), I would do more than just throw in veggies and noodles in a burrito- i would add salt as a bare minimum and atleast one other spice.

            "The Terrace is a great place to grab a bite to eat. If you're a fan of burrito bowls, then this is the spot for you. On Wednesdays and Fridays, the restaurant serves up an excellent burrito bowl with orange chicken that is simply delicious (even though it might sound funny). In fact, it's my favorite dish to order on campus.\n\nThe line is usually pretty long, especially around lunch time, but the service is fast, and the food is always fresh and tasty. The burrito bowl is generously portioned, so you'll definitely get your money's worth.",
            "Thank you for the 5-star review! We are so happy that you are a fan of Orange Chicken, and we hope to see you at Terrace again soon!",
            "When we arrived with our party the restaurant was under construction and the handicap sidewalk was closed.   It seems like this restaurant is always under construction.\nUpon entering there was no one there to check in with regarding our reservation.   There were 2 parties in front of us,  the host would show up,  go check on the party's table,  come back and get the party and leave again.   Most restaurants the host hands this off to another person.  As well,  even though the host do incredibly nice,  he was dressed in jean shorts and sneakers.   This looked terrible for such an incredible restaurant.   We got tired of waiting so we went to the bar and figured we'd pop back in a few minutes.   The bartender was obviously overrun and she was miserable!  Took forever to get a drink and then I was given a substitute to what I requested and was never told.   The minute I drank it I knew,  but that's not how you do business.\nThe service at the table was phenomenal.   No complaints!  The food on the other hand really left a lot to be desired.   The pork was overcooked, not dry but toug, the lobster roll itself was dried out, the brussel sprouts were covered in a sauce that was terrible, and the Ahai nachos were all chips and little topping.  All in all f for a $300 meal we were incredibly unhappy and would probably never go back.   Such a shame.   Such a beautiful place.",

            "The burrito bowls are really good. If you're there on Wednesday or Friday, you can get one with orange chicken. It sounds like a weird crossover, but it works very well. The gyro station is also pretty good--I get the falafel sometimes. A bit overpriced and the lines are always long as hell, especially for the burrito line. The area to dine in is big, but it can still get crowded and kinda dirty during peak times",

Sometimes can be difficult to find an open table to sit at.",

The dining area can become a bit of a mess, but it's relatively clean for a continuous-service cafeteria situation.  Overall, for food on center campus, this is a good choice.",

            "As a student at Cornell University, I eat at Terrace at least once or twice weekly. It consistently maintains its high standards as the best, affordable dining facility on campus. I was prompted to write this review because the customer service and food quality are unbeatable. I hope that everyone reading this review makes the wise choice to try it. My review will explain why \u201cTerrace\u201d is an outstanding culinary choice.\n\nTerrace has two components that make it stand out: great food and great customer service. The food is fast, reliable, and consistent. It offers an amazing burrito line, a tasty salad bar, and a savory pho station. My favorite dish is the Steak burrito bowls offered on Monday and Wednesday. If you like spicy food, try the \u201cBoom Boom\u201d sauce. The food speaks for itself, but what makes Terrace really shine is the employees who run it. Every employee is kind and they all greet their customers with a warm, welcoming smile. Employees are all trained to be efficient and treat guests with respect.\n\nTerrace is the best fast-casual restaurant Ithaca has to offer due to its customer service and high-quality food. If you are on campus, \u201cTerrace\u201d is worth the trip. I highly recommend everyone reading this post to give it a shot.",

I wish there was less pork served (especially in the pasta), I wish that the customizable pasta station was open more, and I wish that they could hire more people and improve the dishroom operations to more consistently utilize reusable items.  You can partially thank me for recent improvements in that last one, specifically involving separating your utensils into bins at the dish drop :)",

Even though we aren't members (graduate student family), paying per visit is quite affordable, especially considering the vast variety of menu options. I appreciate the inclusion of halal food and the irresistible Cornell dairy ice cream! Fantastic spot!",
            "I was here ten years ago and then I let for a reason however this time when I came back the food is being decreased. They are not as good as they used to be. I remembered at time, Cornell dining were on the top ranking of the university dining\u2019s . However, I mean this time it was even worse. They are not as good as the dining in the university of California or the university of Texas. Please pay attention to the our students. Either increase the choice of the food or change the price of the dinning\u2019s! !Big red bears.",
            "Morrison Dining Hall is a brand new, modern, and huge area with a great variety of food - ranging from pastas & pizzas to breakfast omelettes and stir fry.\nThe western omelette is delicious, as well as the blueberry & banana overnight oats.",
            "The food was really good. There is a variety of dishes ranging from salads to udons to pizzas. The pasta was especially good. It was cooked to order and the chefs are really skilled in making it. Six different options for ice cream and many cookie and bread selection for dessert. Overall the food was good and I would come here again.",
            "My husband said Let me take you out for lunch and we went to Morrison dining. I was truly blown away that it was a college campus. I enjoyed the atmosphere as well as seeing all the chefs cooking and prepping the food right in front of you. All the different stations that you can choose from as well as the amazing prices. All you can eat for under $15 and all of the food is amazing in each station.\n\nI believe my only complaint would be I wish that the staff would smile more.  Other than that I enjoyed the food and the company.\nLooking forward to returning \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe",
            "A very nice dining hall, modern set up. Food is generally pretty good, but it does get repetitive cycling through the same stuff over and over-- there is quite a bit of pork in different capacities. Nice to have a number of options from pizza to the salad bar to desserts-- quite good dairy and ice cream options in particular.",
            "Easily the best dining hall on campus. It's huge, and it's got a good variety of food. Apparently if you're eating here every day, it can get a little repetitive, but if you're just eating here a few times a semester as someone who doesn't live on North, then it's great. Pasta, pizza, salads, halal, Asian fusion... most of it surprisingly good. I wish they could hire more people so they could use washable plates and bowls though.",

Staffing shortages can result in inconsistent experiences, so visiting somewhere on Cornell's West campus can sometimes be a safer bet.",

Moreover, the lackluster decor further dampened the dining experience. It's disheartening that a cafeteria of lesser quality exists on a campus renowned for its premier status. The subpar offerings were a letdown, and the overall experience was a missed opportunity to complement the institution's standards.",
            "Pros: The location is on central campus and therefore near where the majority of lecture halls are. It also consistently offers soup, which a lot of other dining halls that I have ate at doesn\u2019t. The place also took good safety very seriously, during the time I had worked here as an employee, and the people here are generally nice. That\u2019s pretty much it.\nThe food is generally lacks in variety compared to a place like Morrison. However, during the times I ate here, the lemonade is always in stock, which is a plus, and the dish drop area isn\u2019t a dumpster pile.\nHere\u2019s the reason for my bad review, which I rarely ever write:\nThe bathroom is located outside of the hall itself, so you would have to leave and come back if you suddenly need to use it in the middle of your meal. This I would advise against, as the person managing the check in had wanted me to swipe my card again when I returned, despite the fact I had done so before and already have food placed on the table. In order to not starve until morning the next day as I only have one swipe left that I wanted to use for dinner, I asked to just grab my stuff and leave and wasted full plate of fresh food. A competent place would probably do something more efficient, like asking students to leave their IDs at the swipe counter for insurance. I hope this place gets better as I rather not walk all the way to north campus for lunch on Mondays, and the people and manager are normally nice, but this incident just soured a lot of my feelings for this place.",
            "Okenshields rarely wows. Today, it was good and with good variety but on most days it is underwhelming with a lack of variety and sappy fare. Events like the Okenshields night breakfast connect well with students but it is not due to to the quality of the food itself. I prefer the other dining halls, especially those on North Campus but Okenshields truly is well located. So central, almost next to the clock tower.",
            "The food was okay. The specialty meal for the day was done well, but their staples were petty meh. Overall a decent experience, and there's certainly a wide selection. Just maybe not too much if you're vegetarian.",
            "Most convenient place to eat on campus. Only eatery that accepts meal swipes on central.\n\nFriendly staff, great music.\n\nFood is consistent, if not great. Dim sum on Fridays is very good! Special events are also nice (e.g. Valentine's fondue station).\n\nNot very accessible to wheelchair users.",
            "Okenshields is the only \"all-you-care-to-eat\" dining hall on Central campus where students can use a meal swipe. Expect long wait times and difficulty finding a seat during peak hours. Decor reflects that you are in a historic building, but things can get messy with so many students in and out.",
            "Even though it is a meme, I have to admit it is not as bad as everyone says. As the only meal swipe dining hall on Central Campus, it is a bit crowded around lunchtime. The food is good, definitely better than most other dining halls in the US. Compared to West Campus dining halls at Cornell, it falls short, but due to its location, it is an ideal place at which to go eat.",
            "Okenahields is one of the smaller dining halls in Cornell but it is always consistent. You know what to expect. Their salad bar is really good and I also really like their Asian fusion station. The location is also fantastic because it is right on central campus. In fact it is one of the only swipe dining halls on central campus. I go there for lunch 3-4 times a week and sometimes dinner. Some people don\u2019t like it because it is repetitive but I enjoy it!",
            "My least favorite dining hall on campus. The setup is terribly inefficient, lines out the back of the main room because everyone waits in one line instead of having smaller lines for each item. The meal variety is awful. Assorted grilled cheese three times a week is not a meal. Central desperately needs another dining hall that takes swipes.",
            "Okenshields is fairly good option for dining in Cornell's central campus. It is the only all you can eat dining hall on central campus so it tends to attract a lot of students (especially around lunch).
